        "review": "I find the sushi here to be run-of-the-mill.   The I-17/Northern-adjacent strip mall restaurant is kind of quiet and subdued compared to the Scottsdale joints, and I like it that way.  I come here when I want something dependable in the central Phoenix area without driving clear out to Scottsdale.\n\nThe fish here for the most part is fresh - nothing too creative here, and the interior isn't much to crow about either.   I find the sushi here to be better than Zen 32 (and cheaper), but not quite at the caliber of other standout places in town.\n\nP.S.  I find the name a little peculiar.  Mr. Sushi??  I would normally scoff at a place called Senor Taco, Ms. Pasta or Madame Hot Dog.  But for some reason I'm ok with the cheesy name."

        "review": "Last night, I met some friends for all you can eat sushi at Akaihana. It was $24.95 for just about everything on the menu. There were a few items that were not included but believe me, it was only a few. The place was packed as they had been offering this deal all day. It only happens a few times a year, usually around the holidays so you have to be in the know as its not advertised unless you of course frequent this place on a regular. A friend of a friend is a regular customer there so she not only knew all about it, but she even has a roll named after her and they know her by name. (Try the Karen on the menu, its  very good) \n\nIt took awhile for our rolls to come out as again it was packed and there were only 3 sushi chef working, but once they started rolling out it was all hands on deck. I don't even remember what I ordered anymore because I was greedy and had way more than I should have. (It was all you can eat you know)  But I do know that the rolls were huge and here were plenty of them. If you check out there menu online its only a small snapshot of the actual sushi menu as its pretty extensive. I will be back to check out their happy hour in the near future."

I started with my \"go to\" California rolls, and tried for the first time some Vegas rolls, and some other rolls of which the names escape me right now.  It was all pretty good, I'm sure there is better out there but on this day I left with my Sushi craving satisfied."

First thing you should know they have HH EVERYDAY from 4-6pm...om the weekends 3-6. My friend and I checked it out a few months back on a Saturday to see what this place was all about. It was day time, in a strip mall..large windows so I don't know how it could possibly be considered dark if you went in the daytime. Its not a fancy place, it's not a RA or Kyoto..so if you want atmosphere and pretentiousness, yes by all means stay away. For the sushi however...they have the most unique rolls I have encountered thus far in AZ. \n\nex: \nMEXICAN -   Tuna, cucumber and habanero,topped with masago \nAUSTRALIAN OUTBACK- Mackerel, tuna,tasmanian abalone, avocado with mango sauce \nBUTTER ME UP  -Tuna tempura, avocado,seared salmon, topped with garlic wasabi butter \nTODD (Volcano) 15.00 \nBaked spicy tuna, cucumber,avocado, with shredded crabstick, sits on top of orange,with special sauce and lit on fire \n\nI kid you not.. they have some crazy rolls and we ordered 4.. which included the Butter Me Up listed above. The presentation was phenomenal and so was the food.\n\nWe did not experience screaming kids or squeaking fans?? Anyway I was so excited by this find that I sent my boss there and he LOVES sushi. It was him, his wife and their 3 kids (who are very well behaved i might ad). They went for the HH and they loved it. They walked out of there spending less than $50 for the 5 of them..That's numerous appetizers and rolls.\n\nSeriously you can't beat this place for unique rolls and prices. Who cares where it is or what it's name is. This place was freakin fantastic ."

I tried the rainbow roll, and a philly roll and I knew I had to come back.\n\nSo a couple weeks later, I brought the bf and we went for happy hour, and yes, it was. We tried a few rolls, miso soup, squid salad, and the green tea blended drink! Mmm mm! Also mochi. We will be going back soon.  \n\nInside is not very fancy, but who cares? It's a great neighborhood sushi restaurant."

        "review": "I have now eaten here at least 10 times, and I'll say the sushi is great every time, but the service is a little hit or miss.\nMe, my bf, and his friend came during happy hour today around 5:25pm and no one came to take our drink order, but the hostess noticed it had been about 5 minutes and she did offer to get our drinks.\nHowever, oddly, the green tea was quite watered down. We mentioned so and were brough fresh green teas, which were much better.\nWhen our server took our order, he was definitely in a hurry. He never brought us plates, accidentally put our sriracha sauce at the table behind us, and actually set his tray down on our table with our soups and teriyaki chicken, and walked away for us to serve ourselves. A different server gal noticed and came to retrieve the tray. \nAs for the rolls, tasty as usual. We shared the Tootsie roll (cooked salmon and crab), Kodiak roll (cooked salmon and avocado), fried California roll, and Blue Flame roll (crab salad and crab stick with avocado, deep fried). They were all very good, but the deep fried rolls were a little over cooked.\n This is the first time we've had an experience this much less stellar than other visits, but overall, we still had a tasty dinner, and for 4 rolls, 2 green teas, 3 miso soups, 1 rice, squid salad, and chicken teriyaki (one of the best!), the total was $38. Can't really complain there. \nWe'll definitely be back again soon, maybe a little earlier next time."

        "review": "So the place goes by a couple names, Its also known as Mr. Sushi. So when you are trying to find it, just look for the Marie Calendars, turn into that parking lot and then drive straight back to the little hidden strip mall area. The sign on the building says Akaihana, The sign on the window says Mr. Sushi....A bit confusing. \n\nWe got there at about 6pm last night. There were a few tables seated but it was pretty dead. We got seated right away and placed a drink order. \n\nThey have a pretty large menu and offer a TON of sushi. We placed our order and had everything in about 20 minute. Pretty fast. \n\nNow, Like I said in my Roka Akor review...I am not a sushi girl, AT ALL. So I ordered the vegetable tempura dinner. It was tasty. I did sneak a couple pieces of sushi to see if I liked it. \n\nThe soft shell crab roll was gross. I was not a fan, it had a real fishy flavor to it. ACK! \n\nOn the other hand, the tempura fried shrimp roll was YUMMO! \n\nI did not eat the other stuff, there was a spicy tuna roll and some other something that the hubs ordered. \n\nBy the time we left (8pm) the place had filled up. It looked like there was only one waitress, but she was running her ass off and doing a good job at keeping everyone happy. \n\nI would go back here if someone said they wanted to go, but its not on my list of must go to places. \n\nGive it a try."

When you go in, you see the sushi counter with one Japanese chef and rest, Mexican chefs.  They seated us at the very back corner where it was pretty dark.....it was so dark that we had to squint our eyes to see the menu.  There were screaming kids, squeaking fans all over and waitresses having fun chatting.  The food...omg, it's as bad as Ra.  We ordered combination plate b., i., and \"mistake\" roll.  Believe me they are all BAD....afterwards, I got a tummy ache......sigh.\n\n*Ambiance = dark, low-class\n*Service = if you like your waitresses having fun chatting about their relationships and stuff, yeah you will like it\n*Food = .....BAD\n-beef teriyaki = TOUGH\n-sashimi = it's interesting how a Japanese person can serve that proudly and call it sashimi.\n-california roll = we usually do our best to finish the plate but it was just not possible.\n-tempura = ok overall but they definitely use OLD oil\n-rice = cheap rice for sure."

The happy hour menu is excellent and gives you a wide variety of things to order, from Miso Soup or Cucumber Salad for appetizer to sushi and even Saki. \nYou definitely can fill up on tons of Akaihana goodness on a small budget when you go during happy hour. They make delicious Jalapeno Poppers and I order them every time I'm there. My roll favorites are Tootsi and Rainbow. \nThe bar area is relatively small, but the table area is definitely spacious. Servers are always friendly and I have had consistently good service there."

        "review": "After getting into a discussion with a coworker about the merits of spending large amounts of money on single Japanese dinners, a craving for sushi set in.  I didn't think there were any good sushi bars nearby work, but considering we were just having lunch, I was OK with average sushi for this occasion.  The reviews for this place were middling, but the photos painted a different picture, so we gave it a shot.\n\nWe rolled up to the place, and found an empty business park, except for this one restaurant set back from the main road.  Definitely a hole-in-the-wall, and not a location the hipsters and yuppies will be flocking anytime soon.\n\nWe sat down at the bar, and noticed a wall plastered with different specials.  Some rolls, some not rolls, some frog legs, some soups, etc.  A complete olio of handwritten dishes, some of which may have been up there for ages for all I could tell.\n\nI ordered an assortment of sushi, the grilled hamachi kama, the ankimo (any place that serves ankimo is automatically above average), a bluefin toro hand roll (not on the menu, but I asked the chef to make me one), and an uni shooter.\n\nAs the sushi arrived, it became clear to me that the chef actually knew what he was doing.  He was an older Japanese gentleman with a hard-to-decipher accent, and clearly he was trained in the art of traditional sushi.  The sushi was properly garnished such that I didn't have to use soy sauce on but one or two items, the rice properly melted in my mouth, and the meal was properly paced.\n\nThose who prefer their sushi Americanized and doused in wasabi may not find this place to be anything special, due to its lack of \"scene.\"  But as a fan of traditional sushi, I would say this is one of the top three places I have found in the Phoenix area. And to think I had worked less than a mile away for nine months without knowing about it!"

I forgot how wonderfully fresh and delicious their sushi is.  I happened to be driving home the other day on a different route and decided to stop. The place is comfortable and i LOVE the bar.  They have tons of paper signs advertising their hottest and newest creations... the sushi staff are friendly and the patrons usually are as well.\n\nI had a \"bubba gump\"  special.... shrimp, wrapped with shrimp and more shrimp...with shrimp on top.  YUM!  The Caterpillar roll is as good as any i have ever had.\n\nOne bite of the Lobster Tempura roll, and i am hooked again.  The sweet lobster flavor sent my senses off on Mr Sushi addiction.  I'm writing this review at 9 am, because if i was writing it during their working hours... i would probably put my computer away, get in the car and have sushi for breakfast.  It was that good.  seriously.  Now that I think about it, I'm probably going there for lunch."

Food came out way quicker than I thought it would and was not too shabby, perhaps a little pricey for what we got but not that big of a deterrent. The Mexican Roll is a slice of Hell in your mouth (not necessarily a bad thing) and honestly, their Baked Scallop/Dynamite/'whatever it's called in your neck of the woods' Roll is the best one I've EVER had. Very generous with the scallops and surimi and the roll still didn't disintegrate under the weight of the baked goodness. The GF wasn't a fan but we will try it again for happy hour, minus the large group."

Sushi! \n\nThis was the place I lost my sushi virginity to, and the place responsible to getting me hooked! \n\nI love the location, right off of the freeway, as if it were a sushi pit stop! The best part of this place is it's very low key and casual. A comforting place to pig out on sushi. The sushi is very authentic which is rare in an over-sushied city. Each roll is beyond delicious and made to perfection. This place is underrated. Grade A rolls at a low key location? Awesome!! \nThe service is also very speedy, hooray!

Normally I would have knocked it down to a four star, but the Toro was so clean and at such a good price, I had some spine tingling moments with my favorite food of all time. \n\nPlease work on the service (I know it's a busy night but you should know that going in), but Chef's keep up the amazingness. : )"

Even though it was just 11:30, as we approached, we noticed it was already getting busy. That's a good sign in my book. Interior is nothing fancy, just functional. Staff was friendly, fast and efficient in every way. My son had the Udon and sashimi and I opted for the tempura lunch special and Nigiri. Couldn't be more pleased with our meal.

        "review": "So this place has the best sushi in Phoenix hands down. They have some exotic rolls on the menu, and this place makes a big roll. I had the surf & turf roll and it was Freakin YUM! Surf & Turf roll has tempura shrimp, crab salad mix, cucumber, asparagus, and topped with lightly seared beef. This roll has the most flavor in roll I have ever had, it was smokey and delicious. Also it has a sauce on the plate which I think is simply mayo and sriracha sauce. I love sriracha sauce. The lunch special for $9 is a great deal. Comes with soup salad a roll or small entree. Inside it is very plain. Customers can create there own roll and if its good they will put it on the wall. We also got the tempura veggies, very good. Its hard to mess that up, you could put tempura on anything and it would be good. This place is kinda hidden back off the main street in a little business area. Not a place with atmosphere but a place with excellent sushi! Im so happy I live so close to this place I will be here often. They have happy hour specials everyday including weekends. At lunch the rolls are sold ( not the exotic rolls) at happy hour prices as well. GO HERE, you will not be disapointed at all. Huge rolls, good HH prices, and the for me the best sushi I have had."

Its tempura shrimp with cream cheese, scallions, a spicy mix I cant remember the name of, and then topped with yellow tail a slice of jalapeno, and sriracha sauce. Its soooo good. I know some people dont like cream cheese in there rolls I happen to like it a lot, but there are some of the best exotic rolls on the menu I have ever seen. Also I tried the jalapeno poppers to. Not your average poppper but realy good. They came with a smokey sauce and were good for $3.50. HH prices at lunch.  Check this place out! Killer bannana dessert!!!"

Nestled inside the chasm of a very non descript strip mall off the beaten sunny slope path on Northern and the 17 Freeway..\n \nI looked to it as a hidden sushi island .. hidden away from the world for me to discover... So I discovered.. and here is my report..\n\nO.k. happy hour.. A couple of names Mr Sushi or Akaihana which I think means \"red flower\". Reading other peoples reviews going back I guess it has had a few names? ..\n\nAnyway ..Its a good lunch and quick drink place. not much else I am pretty certain of.\n\nI have eaten here twice now and I am glad I did before reviewing it. tonight's subsequent visit has served as a more complete look at the place.\n\nThe first time I ate there I ended up sitting next to the owner by total coincidence. It was he who guided me to the specialty hand rolls. I had the lobster the butter me up and a few others that he recommended. I would give that experience 4 stars.\n\nThis time however... unfortunately for me was not quite the experience of the previous one :{\nThe happy hour was crowded Tonight so it took a while to get any service.. I sat there for a good 10 min before getting my beer. Whatever it was busy..but I had to wait 5 min for them to even look at me when I walked in the door. Sorta annoying..\n\nThe fish was not that fresh and I guess I would expect it to be on a Friday? I had just a simple dragon roll and the thing fell apart trying to eat it. The squid salad was o.k... All for about 20$ with a sake bomber The experience was a 2 star one..\n\nI gotta give them credit that some of the special rolls are pretty tasty.\nThe rest was just average .. and the service this time was pretty painful.\n\nEveryone I have ever talked to in the place has told me it was their favorite..There seems to be good local following... and the place was packed for the new happy hour, so maybe I just got the \"raw\" end of the deal this time?..\n\nYou will want this place to go if your in the neighborhood and certainly go to it for the rolls to at least try em,, but my Yelp app will be primed for a new place the next time I am on the west side."

I was probably about 13 years old when my parents introduced me to Mr. Sushi and I had only ever tried a california roll before.  Well Akai Hana opened my mind to so many other varities of sushi.  I fell in love with tuna :) \n\nThey also serve hot dishes and bento boxes. Very authentic with a variety of seafood, good prices and happy hour all of the time until 5pm and after 8pm-9/10pm depending on the day of the week.  My favorite happy hour rolls are the blue flame, spicy tuna hand roll, and the tuna roll.\n\nThis is probably my favorite sushi place of all time.  My family and I have spent almost every birthday here since I we have been coming here together for about 15 years.  On birthdays the sushi chefs will  make a special roll for you or bring out green tea ice cream with a candle in it and take a couple of polaroid pix for their wall and one for you to take home.  You can also call and request there special room for a more intimate time with a larger party of people.\n\nI highly recommend giving this place a shot-you will have a great experience from the moment you walk in when the sushi chefs personally greet to the moment you leave with a belly full of sushi :)"

Quite tasty, but quite a bit of tuna on top. \n\nLobster Tempura Roll: good sized pieces of lobster. The whole thing is deep fried. Perhaps not your thing\n\nSpicy Yellowtail Roll: a subtle sweetness to it. Definitely worth an order\n\nN*Joy"

They have the best lunch specials and my favorite rolls i order are the Mexican and New York roll. Love their salad dressing and all the different appetizers. \n\nThe only complaint i have about this place is that sometimes they will have a all you can eat night and of course on those nights the place gets packed. They do not seem to have enough staff to accommodate such a large number of customers on those nights. They need better planning on those nights. We must have waited at least 30 minutes just to order."

However I'm ready to move my sushi loyalty if I can find the right place.  Mr. Sushi's food is still great and the prices are OK but the experience has taken a nose dive because we can never get a seat at the sushi bar anymore.  They have dedicated half of the sushi bar to a waitress service area and they never seat people efficiently at the sushi bar so our party of three is always bumped to a table even if three different chairs spread out across the bar are open.  We lose the conversation with the sushi chef, the conversation with other sushi lovers, the motivation to try new sushi and fast service.  They need to get their 'sushi' together before they lose long time customers like us."

Wife's beverage didn't make it out until after 20 minutes of being seated and after 3 requests.\n\n2.  It was hit or miss with some of the rolls we ordered.  The California Roll fell apart when trying to eat it with chop sticks.  The crab mix tasted off.\n\n3.  Server didn't clear the table and we sat with finished plates cluttering our table until we paid our bill.\n\n4.  One of our rolls was forgotten about and was brought out to us when everyone finished their sushi and entrees.\n\nSome positives of Akaihana is that the quantity of sushi was plentiful and the price was very reasonable.

        "review": "I love good sushi, and what I got last night was not good sushi.\n\nThere are some things that I get, or try to get, every time I go for sushi: tamago (not always available), smoked salmon nigiri, and Philly rolls.  Add edamame for an appetizer and I'm pretty happy.  Eel sauce in a ramekin is always a good thing for dipping.  Last night was a great disappointment.\n\nLet's address the specifics of what I ordered.  First, the salmon nigiri was mis-cut.  It should be cut with the grain/fat strands at a right angle to the length of the fillet, so that you can easily bite through it.  It was not, so each bite required additional work to separate the piece you just bit from the remainder.  The flavor of the salmon was marginal, I don't know if it wasn't smoked just right or what.  I don't think the fish was bad in that it didn't smell, but the flavor just wasn't right.\n\nPhilly rolls.  I realize this is 'white man's sushi', but I like it.  I have never been known to leave any sushi standing when I finish my meal, even at a joint in Dallas where I left a scathing review, and yet I left half my Philly rolls un-et.  Numerous problems presented themselves, starting with the rolls were not tight, resulting in them falling apart when picked up.  I'm not sure how to express what was wrong with the cucumber, I think it boils down to it was mushy, not crisp.  Maybe it wasn't cold when cut or they chose the wrong area to cut from?  The flavor was unexceptional, I expect a crisp bite with a punch of the cream cheese, a crisp crunch of the cucumber, and the subtle flavors of the smoked salmon.  This roll had none of that, and thus half of it was left behind.\n\nI will complement them on the tamago, though it was not listed on the menu as such.  This is the first time that I've seen it listed on the menu as 'Sweet Egg', which it is, but if I don't see it under tamago, I assume it isn't there.  But I asked for it, and I got it.  And it was good.  At least this one thing was done well, though it would have held together better if they'd used longer seaweed cuts to wrap the band around it to attach it to the rice puck.  The salmon nigiri, likewise, was not directly on the menu.  I asked for it and got it, but as I said, it was disappointing.\n\nThe edamame was decent, but unremarkable.  They didn't strike me as freshly steamed/hot, possibly they'd been sitting waiting for the waitress.  They also offer 'garlic edamame', I'm not sure what the difference is but it might simply be using garlic salt instead of regular, and it really didn't do anything to enhance the flavor.  Speaking of enhancing flavor, the eel sauce was also disappointing.  I'm not sure what it was, but the flavor just did not appeal.\n\nWe ordered two other rolls there.  One was a crab roll, not a crab salad roll as my companion has a mayonnaise sensitivity, and it was good.  We both liked it.  Pleasant flavors, quite yummy.  The other roll, whose name I do not recall nor do I want to, had an off-putting aroma and the flavor did nothing to overcome that.  A couple pieces of that were also left behind.\n\nAnd glancing at Meg's review in the sidebar, I think there might also be a seasoning problem with the sushi rice.  I'm not entirely certain on that one, but that could explain why many of the flavors were just not quite right.\n\n\nIn the end, a bad evening at a restaurant that will not see us again.  This was also a scouting mission for places to frequent in the future since our favorite sushi place closed down, but this is not a place to which I will be returning.  It is possible that they had their 'B Team' working last night, but my companion and I agreed that one star is all they deserved and we won't be back.\n\n\nOne final comment.  I notice that their ratings have been steadily trending down over the last couple of months.  It seems to me that something has happened here and I hope their decline is temporary for their sake."

I'm from Japan so I know real good sushi and tend to look for that quality. I also know in Phoenix, it's hard to find 'fresh' fish. But still this place is a total disappointment.\n\nFirst, it seems like they forgot to season sushi rice. Totally no taste at all which is very odd. For rolls with lots of other stuff and sauce, it could be acceptable but for nigiri with raw fish, it tasted weird. The fish was not fresh at all and we started worrying about getting food poisoning.\n\nSecond, we ordered takoyaki (octopus balls) which were deep fried. Takoyaki is a very famous and popular local food in Osaka (where I'm from) so I know what real takoyaki is. I've never seen deep fried takoyaki but can accept it if it's good but they were too oily.\n\nAnd the service was below average too. The waitress did not repeat our order and she forgot one of the items we ordered.. The appetizer came fast but after that we waited 20-30mins. They were friendly, though. \n\nThey seem to have many kinds of rolls so if you like rolls and they don't forget to season the rice or you don't mind plain rice, you still could enjoy this place. But the overall quality of the food is low especially compared with other Japanese restaurants like Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe, Shimogamo, etc. \nI don't see any point to go back to this restaurant."

They turn some of the rolls into little character (such as the caterpillar roll). \n\nMy favorite thing about this place is that they are not cheap when rolling their rolls! They come packed with fish and goodies and are a more than average size, which is GREAT for the already cheap price you pay and, of course, for your belly! \n\nYou can never leave this place hungry!\n\n\nThe location is a bit sketchy, the customer service is good but not great or excellent, and the place inside isn't all that great, but I would ABSOLUTELY recommend this place to anyone!

Food quality generally quite good, although I have noted some sloppy preparation lately. I've taken to ordering the catering special Samurai Platter lately to go, 7 rolls for $35. This is probably their best value, but last time the rolls fell apart and the tuna was kind of mushy. Still, they have the best caterpillar roll I've ever had.

And.  There are five thousand different sushi rolls that all sound and taste the same!  We had soft shell crab roll, shrimp with eel, and spicy tuna with cilantro.  The cilantro was a GREAT addition, but the tuna was fishy and strangely colored.  Soft shell crab wasn't terrible, shrimp and eel was really fishy.  I do not believe the Rolls were rolled correctly as they just fell apart. I'm sorry, but I was unimpressed, and we won't be returning.

This idea translates to a restaurant with its elements of food, service and decor.\n\nThe gourmet taco shop La Condesa is still trying to find its own equilibrium, but the line of customers nearly out the door isn't giving the new establishment much of a chance.\n\nLa Condesa is located on 16th Street, just north of McDowell, in a neighborhood that's no stranger to tasty Mexican food, including Tortas El Guero and the popular Barrio Cafe.\n\nWith no shortage of good Mexican food, how does a new place stand out? They do things their own way.\n\nYou'll notice striking artwork on the walls. The art is beautifully lit, and from a visual standpoint it's hard to look away, that's until you see the salsa bar.\n\nOnce you place your order at the counter, you're given a number. Then have a seat and a staffer will deliver a basket of crunchy chips. This is when the fun begins, tapping that salsa bar.\n\nOn each of my visits, the salsa line up was never quite the same, with at least six to choose from. Standouts include an Avocado Salsa that was vibrant and flavorful, the chunky salsa Mexicano and the Creamy Cilantro Salsa.\n\nIf you run out of chips they will refill your basket, but try not to fill up on chips while you wait for your food, because you will indeed wait, and wait, and wait... On each of my visits the kitchen took from 15 to 45 minutes to deliver my order. But don't let this discourage you because some things are worth waiting for.\n\nThe tacos are served on two 6-inch corn tortillas. You can order tacos ala carte ($2.99 each) or as a two taco plate ($6.99) with rice and beans.\n\nThe beer battered Cabo Shrimp version was hot and fresh, yet perfectly crunchy while leaving the shrimp moist and tender. The Sonoran Carne Asada had a great flavor but was more like jerky, tough and dry.\n\nBurritos were mostly a miss, while paying a premium ($7.29). You can choose shrimp or mahi mahi. Mine were filled with too much rice and not enough seafood.\n\nHowever the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Burro ($6.99) was an absolute killer. Filled with luscious roasted pork shoulder, it was so tender you don't need teeth to eat it.\n\nThe handmade Corn-Quesa is going to bring me back. They take fluffy corn masa and fold it around your selection of fillings, then use their deep frying to create a unique and substantial alternative to tacos and burritos.\n\nBeing a purist, the Traditional Quesa ($5.49) was one of my favorites, simply filled with gooey Oaxaca cheese.\n\nThe same Oaxaca cheese is paired with the earthy flavors of mushrooms in the Maria Sabina Quesa ($6.99).\n\nFor me, the thing to order is the Azteca Tinga Quesa ($7.29). Stuffed with shredded chicken, tomato, onion and chipotle sauce, the flavors were complex and each bite was sheer bliss.\n\nService is friendly and on some nights you might even see the owner's kids helping out."

I found a table with enough light to read the magazine I had brought along, but then loud music started playing, so I couldn't hear myself think anyway, & it played during my entire visit.\n\nThere were a variety of tacos offered, & a combo including two tacos plus rice & beans was priced ok at $6.99.  \"Vanessa\" brought me a basket of chips & took my order for a Combo with a dogfish shark taco & a Carne Asada one.  There were an array of salsas available on an iced table, & I tried several of them with the chips while I waited for the main items.  The chips were blah, but the salsas were good, especially the green Cilantro one.\n\nThe rest of the food was ok too, but it would have been more enjoyable if it hadn't been for the blaring music.  Forty minutes after I had arrived, I went up to the counter to pay, & one other customer finally entered the restaurant.  So much for it being a busy place.\n\nWham!  Instead of $6.99, I am being charged $8.79!  What's this?  Vanessa points out to me that in tiny print at the bottom of the menu it says that if your two tacos aren't the same as each other, then it's $8.79.  That's too much for what it was.\n\nBack home, I looked at La Condesa's menu on their Website.  There, they do tell you up at the top that they will charge you extra for two different tacos, but the new higher price shown there is $7.59, not $8.79.\n\nToo many problems here, & I'll never return, but since the food itself was pretty good, I'll bring it up to 2-Stars.    :-("

Given that I'm not much of a \"regular\" (I crave variety to an unhealthy degree), this says a lot. \n\nBoth times I've gone, I ordered the La Condesa shrimp tacos, which were positively fantastic. The shrimp is great quality and perfectly grilled to bring out its natural sweet flavor. I also love the robust veggie filling, including sauteed spinach, onions and peppers - the spinach is especially flavorful and a unique addition for sure. My only gripe with the tacos (and this is just a personal thing) is that each comes with two corn tortillas, which appears to be necessary to hold the hearty fillings but is a little carb-heavy for my tastes. \n\nBut who I am I kidding? By the time my tacos arrived, I'd already devoured an entire basket of delicious, not-too-greasy chips with a ton of great salsas from the salad bar. Why stop there? :)\n\nSpeaking of salsa, while I like the more traditional ones, I think that the unusual flavors are the most delicious. For example, the sesame one tastes great drizzled on top of the shrimp tacos, and the peanut one was really solid with the chips. Both Asian-seeming sauces. Both surprisingly great matches for the savory Mexican flavors. \n\nThe final thing I wanted to mention is the Jamaica (pronounced Huh-my-kah) drink, which is essentially sweetened hibiscus tea. It's delicious but I think it's a tad too sweet for me. I'd love if it was watered down a bit. \n\nThis is definitely my new Sunday spot, but of course, check back with me in a few weeks.

The Quesa was delicious, quite filling and actually made two meals for me.  Just a note: mole does not do any better in a microwave on high than gravy, but it still tasted fine.

The obscure and hoody street it resides on has always kept me hesistating until one day! Before I immersed myself into the unknown, I had to do some Yelp investigation.  I wanted to know which taco(s) in particular people were raving about.  Coincidintally, the ones people tipped about were the ones I also adored! \n\nI kept seeing Yelpers talk about them dogfish shark tacos, so I knew I had to order those first along with the can't-go-wrong carne asada! First thing that happens upon entering the cool, wooden door, you place your order at the counter and find an open seat once a number is assigned to you. \n\nBeing that they specialize in tacos, I focused on just that (for now)! They do have burritos and other things but its all about the tacos!  Here are your options:\n\n1 Taco: $2.99, will not fill you up, but it is still a decent size.\n\n2 Taco Plate: $6.99, you get 2 tacos of the same core ingredient (ie. Carne Asada, Fish) plus 2 sides (refried beans and rice)\n\n2 Mix Taco Plate: $8.29, you get to choose any 2 tacos from the menu, plus the sides I mentioned.\n\nBeverage is additional.\n\nWhat I have tried thus far:\n\n1. Dogfish Shark Taco:  Killer! What makes these so awesome is in the beer batter!  They are super crispy, hot and the fish itself is still soft and moist!  \n\n2. Shrimp: Again, Killer! Comes out very similar to the shark tacos, except it is shrimp!\n\n3. Carne Asasada: Holy cannoli folks! Some might argue that America's Taco Shop are better but I would say the quality and taste is near even!  Condesa might edge them with its overall composition and various salsas!  It had that mesquitte, charred off the grill kind of taste and cut perfectly to fit into a taco!\n\n4. Cochinita Pibil (Pork): The first three tacos I mentioned were pretty darn good! But this one stood out quite well on its own.  It was savory and packed with excellent flavors!  As the menu stated, it was slow-cooked, fork tender!\n\nThe 2 sides-\n\nRefried Beans: Excellent! \nRice: Excellent! perfectly cooked!\n\nThe cool part about dining here is enjoying their Salsa Bar! If I recall correctly , there were about 10 different salsas to choose from!  The tricky part is pairing it with the taco you just ordered! Experiment, I say! As part of every order they bring you a basket of warm, house chips!\n\nFrom the outside, you would never assume that such a great taco place existed, but once you step inside you know something good is about to happen!  Every wall has some sort of hip and contemporary Mexican art, from flowers to people.  The overall decor is very tasteful and upbeat!\n\nStaff members are very friendly and courteous!\n\nI took my office colleagues out during my second visit and they have nothing but positive responses and is begging to come back for more!\n\nWhether you are a connoiseur of Mexican cuisine, tacos or just love eating good food, I highly advise you stop by!  For the overall great taste and value, its hard to beat this cool taco spot that will please all your senses!"

They Mexican art was cool and the bathrooms were also cool, but he men's bathroom door doesn't close all the way, but whatever.  \n\nThe Tacos were delicious, they are street style and are made up of 3 layers of corn tortillas with simple cabbage.  The mole actually had flavor as compared to some other places where it can be kind of dull.  The carne asada was spot on.\n\nI have to admit I was skeptical because I was thinking it was just another overrated hole in wall, but it is quite good and I will be back.  I wish there was one on my side of town.  Sketchy area but with places like this opening up over there, then the area just improves, even if I was asked to buy a used DVD player and converter box by street type people on the way out, but what can you do?\n\nSummary: great tacos, friendly people, awaiting liquor license, and decent creative salsa bar, cool place that improves the area.  I hope they will sell margaritas that would go well with those tacos. We'll be back for sure!!\n\nps I want that cool Mexican day of the dead art!"

I really enjoyed the way that the restaurant was decorated; it definitely creates its own vibe, and it's not painted with a lot of loud colors (there are a ton of pictures of the decor if you look at the pictures). It's very classy to say the least.\n\nThe salsa bar is the first thing that I have to mention. It was overflowing with variety and flavor. Every time that I thought I'd found one that I liked, I tried another and pushed the previous aside. My girlfriend and I managed to polish of two baskets of chips without a problem or remorse because we had to try every salsa. The tamatillo and cilantro were two of my favorites in the mix. \n\nWe also ordered the Mayan Conchinita Pibil tacos and the Aztec Tinga tacos. I'm usually hesitant about chicken on tacos because I usually always have bad experiences, but not here! The tinga taco was great. The meat was tender and well marinated - I could taste the sauce in every bite. The conchinita though is what really won me over. The pork was so good! Imagine the tenderness and juiciness or your favorite BBQ pork sandwich, but replace the flavor with a bevy of delicious Mexican spices and we'll pretty much be on the same level.\n\nI'm pretty baffled that I didn't see a lot of my Yelp friends raving about this place. As a result, I will send this review out to you all (go try it =) ). This is a great little place that isn't pricey yet brings great flavor. The next time I got there I will be getting a quesa, no question, and hopefully I will be going back very soon."

        "review": "La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop \n\nAfter a long break from Yelp, I knew that eventually I would find myself in a situation where I could no longer hold my tongue, and my need to share would overpower my desire to remain silent. La Condesa GTS created just that situation. \n\nI entered this space wound tighter than a spring ready to pop. Surely there could be no way that it could meet the lofty expectations set forth by my fellow yelper's reviews. But there is something very pure about this place, and as I stepped through the over-sized wood door, I knew this southwest girl was home. \n\nThe best way I can describe the atmosphere is Southwestern Minimalist. Monique H was dead on with her praises for the artwork - The Blue Demon (long live Alejandro Mu\u00f1oz Moreno) proudly intermingles with Diego and Frida and the acid treated floors feel natural. I also liked that this is clearly a community effort, with the art work provided by two exceptional Mexican artists (Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez) and the furniture/d\u00e9cor provided by Bellas Artes de Mexico. I love that there is already a partnership, holding this little gem up until it can take flight. \n\nThe food is clean. The flavors crisp. The portions more than adequate, and the prices less than I would expect to pay for such quality. Most selections can come in the form of a taco, a quesadilla, or a burro, although there are one or two additional options under both the quesadilla and burro menus. Each flavor combination is clearly described and in a handful of situations, there are salsa suggestions outlined on the out of this world salsa bar. The best way I can describe this is to think of a wine pairing with a food that will make flavors pop... in other words, just try it because the sum of the parts is way better than the individual components! \n\nThe Mayan Conchita Pibil and the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken are two of the finest examples I've had of either. Both are mouth wateringly moist and fairly melt. I would suggest the Peanut or Mexican salsa as additional choices for the MCP for the spicy recommended habanera. The guacamole and cilantro salsas were both mild choices and if the mole were not already a mouthful of perfection, might be the additional layer of flavors that bring you to the tipping point. Personally, I found the pickled onions severed atop with some of the Jicama salsa, tossed in for a little crunch, just enough to make my eyes roll back in to my head. I mean seriously, if I could wiggle around naked in this stuff, it would be a really good night! The Aztec Tinga is deceptively simple. Your first bite may seem relatively ordinary, but then start the countdown. Within a few seconds, the flavors hit you like a wall of emotion. Your lips and tongue begin to tingle with the heat of the perfectly balanced peppers. My BIL has tried the Sonoran Carne Asada and was unusually quiet as he made his way through his plate, so I have to assume that was good as well. Finish things up with those out of the world beans, or some of the grilled Mexican Calabacitas and a meal just can't get much better. \n\nSo much has already been said about the iconic salsa bar, there really isn't much I can add, except to say, try them all! You will find two or three that send you to your happy place. \n\nThe staff was super friendly and more than ready to answer questions or make suggestions. It's an order at the counter and take-a-number kind of place, but you can generally expect several service passes through the dining room. \n\nMy only cautions / suggestions would be to grab a takeout menu so you don't have to stand and look at the wall menu with your mouth gaping like a cod fish and be prepared to park along Palm if the street inset parking area is full. \n\nThis is my new love. I will definitely be adding this in to the regular rotation. At a dinner plate with drink running you between 8 and 9 dollars (with enough food to make two decent sized meals) this is one indulgence I can fit in to my life with little or no rationalizing. Please take the time to check this place out and support yet another wonderful family owned business. Look around when you come in, because I may be joining Joel L on one of his weekly visits. : )"

While waiting to turn onto 16th Street the \"Grand Opening\" sign caught my eye and my little yelping soul leaped for joy!  A new place to try!\n\nIt looked desolate from the outside but when I opened the door I was put at easy by the decor, smell and cleanliness inside.  I ordered dinner for two, to go.  The menu was awesome.  I loved seeing all the variety: poblano peppers, mole, mahi mahi, mushrooms...something wrapped in banana leaves.  It made it difficult to choose something.  Here's what I've had so far: La Condesa Shrimp Burro and Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco.  They are both were very delicious meals but the shrimp burro stole the show.  So much flavor.  I snagged some bites from my hubbys mole and mahi mahi burros- mmmm such a delight.  The salsa bar is endless.  I really stocked up.  I was excited to try the strawberry salsa but it was too hot, in fact it all was, but I'm a big wimp when it comes to hot peppers. The horchata is handmade and delicious.  They throw pecans and some fruit in there too which is a yummy bonus!\n\nAs if the good food wasn't enough to win me over the art in this restaurant sho did!

Great tastes on both. \n\nThe salsa bar is impressive with done really unique styles of salsa, some even have pecan flavor in them!

I realize that I just reviewed this little-slice-of-Heaven last week, but our latest visit deserves an update.  \n\nWe brought my visiting mother-in-law to La Condesa, so we could share the Mexican-food love with her.  For the last two days, I've heard her on the phone to at least 3 different people, raving about the \"amazing\" Mexican food she had on Saturday.  \n\nOn this visit, they had the Carne Asada (they were out last time).  My husband liked it, but actually thought the Tinga chicken was even better.  He swears there isn't a better chicken taco in town, and I think I'd have to agree.  My MIL had the chicken mole tacos and loved them.  She orders mole whenever she gets the chance, and rated it way up with Barrio's dish.  I was blown away by the deliciousness of the mahi-mahi burro.  Oh, goodness... I'm having a flashback of it's amazingness...  luscious chunks of fish, smokey bacon, mushrooms (which I normally pass on, but they were fantastic!), and their velvety cilantro-cream sauce.

Apparently it still hasn't been discovered by the majority of the city yet, which definitely made our Sunday night visit quicker.  \n\nAs we arrived, I immediately fell in love with their door.  Their door? Yep. It is an awesome front door.  And the colors? Love.  Definitely a good start to our adventure.\n\nThe restaurant only had 2 tables filled - thank goodness there wasn't a wait, since we had the child in tow.   On the advice of other yelpers, we ordered two taco platters and a quesadilla.  Unfortunately, they were out of carne asada, my husband's first choice, but the lovely waitress's genuine apology made everything okay (seriously - people underestimate the power of a good apology!).  We ended up with Tinga chicken, veggie and cochinita tacos and a tinga chicken quesadilla.  \n\nWhile we waited for our food, we took our time trying many of the salsas at the salsa bar.  I was so happy that we picked a night that they featured the strawberry salsa.  YUM! Why has no one else thought of this deliciousness before??  Our dinner came out quickly and was perfect.  We absolutely loved every bite - the chicken and pork were tender and so flavorful.  \n\nNormally, I don't even bother to share what I ordered to drink... this place is the exception - HORCHATA.  I'm pretty sure that their horchata is taking steroids or something.... it is unnatuarally good.  I can't imagine going there and not indulging in this lovely rice milk - decked out with tons of fruit, pecans, and cinnamon.  Now, in all fairness, I'm about as white as a sheet of paper... so perhaps I've just never been exposed to amazing horchata before... but this seemed to be the ultimate.   Thanks for showing me the horchata light :)\n\nI am looking forward to a return visit - very, very soon.  And if you haven't been there yet - get going!  Show them some love...

I didn't expect everything to be so big so I really over did myself. The queso I figured was like a quesadilla but it really isn't anything like that. Closest description is a calzone sized gordita. And not the taco bell version. The cheese was gooey and the undercooked parts of the masa were delicious. It was awesome. I broke out the plastic utensils and went to town. Daunting none the less. But I managed to put down half of it before the coma kicked in \n\nThe mole taco was delicious. The chicken was sliced and covered in red onion. The sauce was spicy and not sweet at all. And the whole thing melted in my mouth. The corn taco shells are soft and made to order. The conchinita pibil taco was full of flavor and dripped juices all over the basket. Delicious. \n\nThe horchata is unbelievable. Full of fruit and pecans as well as cinnimon and nutmeg.\n\nthe salsa bar is epic. there was at least 12 different salsas to try. the cilantro was really good. and i normally hate raw cilantro because i burp it. but this was excellent and really brought out the flavor of my food. also the strawberry salsa was hot with a hint of sweet and freshness. and the salsa peanut was very tasty. very. very.\n\nI'm buying a bike just to ride here.

I got there around 1045, so I was that creepy taco stalker in the parking lot for about 15 minutes. I ordered teh La Condesa Shrmip Burro and the Oaxacan Mole chicken Taco. As I waited, I was able to check out the 8 or 9 different salsas they had there. Great stuff, I only packed up four. My fave, by a mile, was the creamy cilantro salsa. I wanna bathe in that stuff, like now. My food was ready pretty quick and I was in and out, which is nice.The taco was great, I really liked the flavor in the mole. I decided to add some of the peanut salsa the had, which was pretty good. I do have to say the Burro did fall a bit flat for me. there were tons of ingredients in tehre, but somehow it seemed to be a bit bland without adding any of the salsas to it.  Kiinda like that girl you see at the club, and y ou get home and...well, you get the picture. It was a good burro, but the shrimp were somehow flavorless and the bacon was non-existent. Not that I'm total food snob but when you tell me there's bacon in that mug, I wanna taste me some bacon. Overall my meal was good, I'm going to go back another day and try some other things on the menu, like the dogfish taco.

There is a menu on the wall; however it is hard to read. Luckily they have printed ones to order from. \n\nDespite the taco centric name I went with a Mahi burrito sans bacon, filled with grilled mahi, mushrooms, pablano pepper and more. The fish was nicely grilled and tender, the texture of the mushrooms really added to the dish. It was wrapped in a soft tortilla was quite good. Every bite I had was accompanied by one of their many salsas.\n\n The salsa bar was one of the first things I noticed walking in. There were eight options. Mild to spicy, Mellon to smoky they have it as an option. One of the more unique salsas is made from watermelon; it is refreshingly spicy and sweet.\n\n A complimentary basket of chips was delivered to our table, some of the chips were good, and however others were undercooked or stale.\n\n The location was a bit hard to find as its part of a small strip of stores and we parked out front which made for a scary exit backing on to a main road. For lunch today it was a bit odd, we walked in around 11:45 and we seemed to be the second customer of the day, with the first waiting for a to go order. The salsas were just being put out.

As with all of their tacos they came as two corn tortillas. Inside was a small amount of grilled vegetables including mushrooms peppers. The items were very well grilled which I liked but it may be a bit too much for most. The Tacos were quite small but to enlarge my meal I only ate the inside tortilla, and then made a salsa, Jamaica, bean and rice burrito with my outer tortilla. \n\nThe chips today were much much better; however they were a bit salty.  Today there were a few new salsa items, including a saut\u00e9ed onions and pepper chutney that was great. \n\nThe salsa bar itself seemed to be a bit neglected in the lunch rush with many of the trays sitting empty and many of the little signs missing the salsa that should have been under it.

And then you get to feast on the humongous salsa bar.  My favorites are the pecan (creamy, thick, and with a kick at the end), cilantro (thinner but delicious), and the tamarindo (sweet and spicy).  Sadly, the tamarindo one seems to be quite elusive and is not always available.  You could spend hours trying all the different salsas.  I agree though with Iain, the peanut was the weak link.\n\n-next comes the real food.  I have only had the tacos, but I imagine everything to be of the same quality.  So these tacos come with double tortillas to hold all the ingredients.  These aren't skimpy by any means.  Two should be sufficient for most people.  The Cabo Shrimp is amazing.  Huge shrimp beer battered with a creamy sauce on top.  The chicken mole taco was also great with that special chocolately flavor to it.  Today, I tried to Mayan Cochinita taco and it was stuffed to the brim with tender as can be pork.  I have had the rice and beans before with a combo and I would say the beans are better than the rice.  Though in my opinion after four or so visits, it's best to come enjoy the chips and salsa and then indulge in two tacos.\n\nThis place is really hard to find, but if you find Palm and McDowell, it's right there with a few parking spots along the street.\n\nIf you like tacos, you need to come here.

The self-described gourmet menu was enticing, many selections I've never seen in person, only read about in my food travel readings, so I was intrigued.  I really wish I was more hungry, I settled on the Queso which was recommended by my server.\n\nThe food takes a bit of time to prepare, but that does give you time to enjoy the salsa bar, which this day included 10 varieties including strawberry, chipolte, a creamy cilantro, guac, pico, can't remember them all.  When my Queso came I was a bit shocked by it's size and relativity to fry-bread, not that this is a bad thing.  The pork inside was unbelievable, comparable in portion size and taste to that of much more expensive places.  Fried cheesy porky goodness, topped with rotating different salsas, each bite was another slice of heaven.\n\nMy gripes:  I have much respect for the work they put in to make this food outstanding, but they are shooting themselves in the foot with the plastic silverware,  cheap baskets and togo cups.  I know doing dishes is annoying, but you need to match your great food with great accoutrement.\n\nAfter writing this, I'm going back today.  Yum."

I received some chips as I left the order counter and stopped at the salsa bar to get some pico de gallo.  When I got to my table I scooped some pico onto my tortilla chip and wow, what great fresh taste!\n\nI also had some tomatillo, jicama and chipotle salsas that I tried on my tacos.  The shark taco was good and the cochinita pibil was even better.

So, this is why I'm a fan of La Condesa... it's simply their beer battered dogfish shark tacos!!! they are soooooooooooooo good, it's like beachside fish tacos without the freaking beach, the taste, smells, and overall experience eating these totally delicious fish tacos can give you a mindf*** yes it's that good! and dipping them these beauties into my favorite salsa of all time.... confetti machine razzle dazzle... the salsa cilantro! it's soooooooo good so creamy, so perfect with their fish taco, and afterwards enjoying their horchata with fruit and cinnamon on top.... HEAVEN! love their quesas, the fish taco, La Condesa you have a fan!"

Casual, nice people, amazing food.\n\nLike other reviewers, I'm partial to the Oaxaca black mole chicken and the cochinita pibil. Everything is delicious in any delivery system -- taco, burro, or (gooey and vaguely depraved) quesa.\n\nThe salsa bar really gets me, though. Experiencing it is to suffer total cognitive arrest and disorganization; it's like love at first sight or stumbling upon a work of great art. Peanut, cilantro, de arbol... bring a sharpie so you can mark the little plastic cups and remember your favorites.\n\nBonus points: The server remembered that I'd asked for strawberry salsa (they were out) on my last visit eight days prior, and offered a totally above-and-beyond apology. Must be something in the mole that sharpens the memory. \n\nGreat place -- a gem."

Others have already waxed rhapsodic about the high points of this little hidden gem: the decor (slightly kitschy, somewhat modern and a pinch of rustic), the salsa bar (over ten types, freshly made and flavorful without the tastebud massacre of straight hot chilis), and the horchata (yummy and light, made unique with the addition of finely chopped cantaloupe and strawberries and a sprinkle of pecans). \n\nBeing a quesadilla fanatic, I got the veggie one. Now, mind you, I had not read any reviews prior to my visit, so I was somewhat disconcerted  by the three pound Mexican calzone that arrived. I'm not complaining -- it was quite tasty -- but the puffy, doughy corn \"tortilla\" exterior was a bit much for me. Oh yeah, and the five handfuls of cheese inside of it. Too much. The damn thing was so big, it eventually became three meals.\n\nMy SO, the ultimate Mexican food snob, dug his chicken burro, although it was overstuffed and gooing and oozing everywhere, requiring him to attempt to consume it with a (cheap, flimsy plastic) knife and fork. Try cutting a hot, goopy mess wrapped in a tortilla sitting on a single thin piece of paper on a wicker basket with bendy cheap utensils. Yeah. Total mess. Not first-date friendly.\n\nThe location, parking, and service are questionable, as others have noted. We beat the rush by going late morning; I didn't think the wait for the food was unreasonable, but I wouldn't be stopping in here for a bite if I was in a hurry.  While I loved the horchata, the fruit was chopped just finely enough to go shooting up the straw unexpectedly. Total choking hazard for the less physically coordinated (read: me). \n\nOverall, pretty, pretty good. We'll be back, although I'll pass on the quesadilla next time..."

Really, the only negative was the cramped quarters.\n\nMy second visit, however, was not nearly as good. On the positive side, I got guacamole this time which was studded with dried cranberries and tasted great with the strawberry salsa. I was impressed with the service too because my friend's order came out the same time as mine despite the fact that we ordered separately 10 minutes apart. \n\nThe tacos this time were awful. I decided to get the vegan tacos since the description of \"no pintos, no rice\" lead me to believe that the beans and rice in the veggie tacos weren't really vegetarian friendly. I'm a pretty strict vegetarian so I try to avoid food that's been prepared with meat-based stock. The vegan tacos come with black beans which were absolutely flavorless. I'm not sure these beans encountered even a grain of salt during their preparation. The tacos also had iceburg lettuce in them which tasted dreadful of course. \n\nSo now I know I can't have their veggie tacos, and the vegan ones suck. No reason to visit again."

I was expecting a divey taco joint but was pleasantly surprised with their old-world style decor: wooden floors and tables, heavy metal chairs, Mexican-inspired art, hand-made pottery plates with their name painted on, and the wooden bar all added a cool vibe to the place, albeit small. \nSpace is very limited and most of their tables accommodate 2 persons. We watched several couples who walked in after us, get seated before us as we were waiting for two tables to open up in order to be able to seat our party of four. \nA basket of chips was brought over immediately and you can then go up to their salsa bar and sample as many as you like. The variety is amazing and it's fun to try so many different types ranging from very spicy to slightly sweet. \nThe menu looks good all around. Tacos, burrito-bowls, tortas which they call lortas, etc. You can order a la carte or as a meal with rice and beans. We opted for the tacos and I tried the vegan, the veggie, and the dogfish shark. I ordered three expecting them to be really small, but I was only able to finish about two! All three were delicious and fresh tasting. Can't wait to go back and sample a few other menu items!\nService was polite, and prompt. I love that they leave a bottle of water on your table for you so we never had to wait for more refills."

I literally had to dig into my memory to remember what I even ate here because I was so amazed by the salsa bar. I literally got up and filled containers nonstop with EVERY single salsa (no shame). I didn't let that go to waste, I tried them all and left little behind. Of course, I loved the spicier selections, but everything was amazing. After eating so much salsa, my pastor burrito came and was pretty good. I think it was a little dry, but nothing salsa can't fix. I tried some of Eric's shark taco and carne asada taco, those were really good! Next time I think I'm going to give a carne asada quesadilla a try!

It's sounds strange, but the pecan salsa was delicious! The peanut salsa was still spicy but had a hint of peanut in it, so it wasn't overwhelmingly \"peanuty.\" There was a strawberry rhubarb pepper type of salsa. This may sound a little too strange for most, but it was almost like a spicy dessert type sauce. Don't forget to order some margaritas to wash those salsa and chips down. I would say you could get filled up on salsa, chips and margaritas alone here and be more than satisfied, but I'm not sure the owners would be too happy about that! The salsa variety was nothing less than astounding! And don't worry your precious little heart. There are traditional ones too: green tomatillo, chipotle red pepper, jicama, and cilantro... just to name a few!\n\nSlow roasted cochinitas pibil (pork) tacos, slow cooked chicken mole tacos, beer battered Dogfish shark tacos, battered shrimp tacos, el gaucho steak in chimchurri sauce tacos with guacamole. Oh gawd, yes! And affirmative... these were all eaten in one sitting.... well, with a little help from Bryan too. He's so thoughtful for that too. I might have died from eating too much.

My BF and I arrived just after 7pm, which was perfect because just after we ordered the place filled up- fast!\n\nThe salsa bar is fantastic! Some of my fave's were the peanut, chipotle, strawberry and a chunky dark one who's name escapes me..... But really they were all good.\n\nThe very best taco that we tried was the Cochinita Pibil (sp?) It was heavenly- packed with meat that had a kind of smokey, kind of mole/chocolaty taste- it was incredible. All the taco's we had were great though. To start with- the tortillas are so freaking good on their own, and they pack the meat inside of them. I'm getting hungry just thinking about them.\n\nLastly, my BF is a lifelong connoisseur  of quesadillas, so we ordered a steak one to split. Holy crap- it was a monster! They split it up for us but it looked like we ordered two of them! Humongous! It resembled a strudel pastry! Big, flaky and lightly drizzled with something white, sour cream maybe? I dunno, but it was to die for!  Even the next day when we reheated our leftovers this cheesy doughy meaty concoction was still fantastic! The chicken tinga burrito was almost BETTER the following day! (Maybe because it didnt have to compete with any tacos)! \n\nAll in all we were very satisfied and will definitely be back. I would like to wait for a bit cooler weather though, because the place is quite warm inside. That is why I only gave it four stars."

We were going to go to America's but we used to live there, so we tried this place out instead. It's right down the road, so we were like \"what the hey.\" Firstly, the outside is so cool looking. With that big ol sugar skull thing. So artsy. I was a little nervous we'd be out of place. But then we thought... \"well, it's not in the nicest area, so it can't be too scenester\" SO glad we made that decision. So we go in with the kids and sit at a table. The seating area is very intimate, I didn't mind that. The decor is really cool, gotta love a place with a great ambiance! The server was really nice, not overly nice. He did a great job. Omg the salsa bar is amazing. We tried them all! The kids loved trying them and naming them. The cilantro salsa.... never had anything like it in my life. \n\nI had the fish tacos that were such a relief. I have had some bad fish tacos in the past so I was a little nervous. But wow. We also had a margarita. They were both strong so I got to finish my husbands. Yay for me! :) \n\nI was a little disappointed that there isn't a kid's menu. I think they should make a small taco plate for kids, and maybe an option for a small burrito with a side of beans and rice. But the kids made due just fine. My daughter had a bean and cheese burrito and my son had 2 of the carne tacos. They both loved their choices and my husband swapped a carne taco with one of my Son's fish so they got to try it all. Yum. The chips were also great and made it nice to be able to dive right in to all the salsa options. \n\nThe price might be my favorite thing. All four of us ate, got drinks, and my husband and I had a margarita all for about 40 bucks including a nice tip. You really can't beat that! We will DEFINITELY be going back to La Condesa!"

I'm not familiar with Phoenix or the surrounding neighborhoods, so I was a little taken aback at first.  The business looks like an old house, as most of the businesses in the area do, i noticed lots of bars on the windows, and the majority of the business signs in the area were in Spanish.  THE ONLY reason I noticed this is because I'm unfamiliar with Phoenix and was traveling alone.\n\nFirst impression, the restaurant is tiny! I would say that at capacity, the restaurant is pretty loud and I had a difficult time hearing my server. The tables were very close together, all the chairs were mismatched, and the lighting was really dim.  It was very difficult to get to the back of the restaurant where they put the salsa bar.  \n\nThe house margaritas were made with fresh grapefruit and lime, and that was perfect for me. Unfortunately, the food wasn't as good.  I had the shrimp burro, and it was really sloppy.  It melted out of the sleeve and fell apart while I was trying to eat it.  Plus, some of the tails were left on the shrimp... let me tell you about shocking!\n\nThe service was sub-par, in my opinion.  My server was inattentive and didn't ask how my food was.  I had to flag down the server like an air traffic controller in order to get my bill, and it took a while to get my bill back.  \n\nThis one is not a revisit for me."

Not much, so I'll just add the following for extra emphasis...\n\n1. The tacos.  Oh the tacos...  even living out in California, the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark tacos are made of dreams and sunshine and sugar plum fairies.  If sugar plum fairies came in the shape of delicious, beer batter fried dogfish shark pieces.  With just a little cream sauce and lettuce so you don't miss out on any of the shark.  And the Cochinita Pibil tacos... there's fall off the bone tender, then there's meat that's pretty much as  close to melting as meat can get.  But these are just my favorites... I've tried all the tacos on the menu, and they're all delicious.\n\n2. The salsa bar.  If I can give this place any criticism, it's that they run out of salsas far too often.  Late in the day.  Just before they close.  Look... sometimes I'm in a peanut salsa mood, sometimes I'm in a chipotle salsa mood, sometimes I'm in a strawberry salsa mood.  I can't help it.\n\n3. The horchata.

I guess that means cultures may come and go but tacos, they are forever, and thank goodness because this place, one heck of an bargain for such a great foodie experience.\n\nThe restaurant, if you don't know what you are looking for, can be easy to drive past so have you smartphone out with the map function on Yelp to make sure you don't miss it. Once I arrived, as it was just me, I sat at the bar instead of taking up a whole table. After ordering my drink, which comes in a take-out cup (and I ordered iced-tea, not the famous Horchata which seems well worth trying) you get a basket of tips and then you can go hit the salsa bar which has at least a dozen different types of salsa. I was partial to the peanut salsa, sort of feels like a Thai/Mexico crossover though the pecan salsa, which creamy, was somewhat bland.  I did especially like the 7 pepper salsa, a mix of roasted green peppers, slivers of garlic and olive oil, from what I could tell and their more traditional red salsas seemed quite good.\n\nI had the two taco special, which is about $10 and comes with a small side order of rice (fluffy white rice with corn in it, nothing special) and a small container of re-fried pinto beans, also nothing special but they look nice on the taco plate. For the two tacos I ordered, and this is a mouthful, the \"Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco\" and some sort of grilled steak taco..both came made with two corn tortillas instead of one and the nice thing, they were not overly soft but had a dry feel to them that kept them from getting soggy from any juices from the taco fillings.\n\nThe grilled steak taco had some sort of lime based topping that was really good and both tacos were quite substantive. The Cochinita taco was made with pork shoulder roasted with some sort of red spice and what tasted like orange juice and topped with pickled onion and it was also quite delicious. I did like adding some spicy salsa to that one to kick up the heat a bit.\n\nThe menu online is rather limited compared to what they offer now but for a meal that was $13 with a drink and tax, it was a great food experience. If this place was up in Scottsdale instead off of McDowell and 16th St (by the way, easy to get there on the 202, just get off on 24th, go to McDowell, drive to 16th Street and turn. I plan to take some co-workers from the office here next Friday so I can share the experience.\n\nOh, by the way, found t his place because it was listed as one of the best new 25 restaurants in Phoenix in Phoenix magazine, and they were spot on. Next time I have to try the Horchata which is enhanced with pecans and fresh fruit. Bottom line, worth you time to go here! :-)\n\nBit of an add on - went back this Friday and boy, even at about 11:30 it was packed. I tried the Horchata this time and the best I've had - I like the pieces of pecan and diced fruit they mix in with it. I also had the steak taco, I guess it is the Condessa taco, that has the spice and olive oil mix on it and it was wonderful, especially with the oil based salsa that tastes like it is made with oil, dried crushed papers and salt, excellent, and I also ordered the grilled squash which, while not amazing, is a nice addition to the meal. I have decided, now that I've eaten there a second time, that I like the grilled steak tacos but the pulled meat, both the chicken and the pork, nothing special, and the side of rice this time, really clumpy and overly sticky, not like what I had last time so I'll give it four stars but need to do something a bit more special with the rice and beans to get a five."

I know that sauce is difficult to make too, so, well done. Most of the tacos actually don't come with cheese - you know why? Because the tacos are so bomb you don't even need the cheese really.

She proceeded to explain the salsa bar, which had about a dozen different salsas though they plan to have 20 in total eventually. \n\nThe chips were fresh, all 5 of the salsas I tasted were delicoius, especially the green cream and the watermelon. My Horchata was amazing, just perfect. They topped it with crushed nuts, and there were strawberry chunks and whatnot in it. Very unique but amazing. My tacos came, and I was quick to pick off the raw onion and replace it with the proper pickled onion slices as it should have come in the first place. No problem, they have the pickled ones at the salsa bar along with all the other veggies. The tacos were full of meat bursting at the seams... large portions were great for me as I'm used to such small tacos. Their refried beans were creamy and well cooked with a nice cheese garnish, and the buttery smooth rice was delicious as well. \n\nFor the fact that this place is nice, decorated with dia de los muertos style art, mexican wrestling posters, the niceness of people, and the excellent food, this place gets five stars as easily as any restaurant I've been to in Arizona. It reminded me of Mama Testa, which has grown to be one of the best known taco shops in San Diego. Phoenix has never seen anything like this. They asked if I want to come back, and I assured them, it will be soon. Very soon."

So what if I was a party of one. Satiation is more important than social appearances. The place is in a mildly sketchy area next to a little market that sells pinatas and a few groceries. To me, this actually lended the place some street cred. Anyway, I like how the restaurant's interior has none of the feeling of a Baja Fresh or Chipotle yet the prices are pretty reasonable. The dining room doesn't look like it can fit too many people so I'm wondering what it's like on weekends. The bathrooms were reasonably clean and I got a kick out of the whole lucha libre motif in the bano for the chicas. \n\nI had a pork mole burro with the mole made with chocolate and nuts. Muy sabrosos but the meat was a tad salty or too kicky, not sure if it was the tanginess or salt that had me asking for more water. But I think that is more a matter of personal taste buds, not the reflection on the cooking. I found the meat quite tender. And I felt like a wimp only being able to eat half the burro. Next time, I will probably do the two-taco deal. There was only one gal doing all the bills and service. She was quite nice. \n\nBut what will make me come back again is their awesome salsa buffet. It makes the salsa trays at chain restaurants look like plainer, less adventurous salsitas. I had the strawberry salsa (sweet yet salty), jicama, cilantro (my favorite but found if you have too much too soon, you'll feel lit) and peanut. It got to the point where I had to tell myself \"no more chips\" so I simply sucked the salsa off a chip like it was a spoon. Yup, it reduced me to that. Anyway, I do need to go back and get some more ideas of the food. But for now, I'm a fan."

As a salsa and hot sauce (they're different, people!) fanatic, I tend to judge Mexican food joints based on their quality of salsa - and La Condesa ranks high!  Last time I was there, I counted 10 different salsas and 2 or 3 different condiments (limes, onions, etc.).  They offer a wide range of salsas from their exotic strawberry salsa, to spicy chipotle, or creamy cilantro.  It looks a little silly with 8 little cups on salsa at your table, but you have to try them all! \n\nThe horchata here is also 5-star material.  Don't be a cheapskate - shell out the $4 for it! Its giant, it will make you happy. And, when you're done with it you can eat the fruit and nuts - the drink keeps on giving! \n\nI have been here twice and have only eaten the veggie tacos, 2 of them are enough to fill me up and they are very delicious!  I must say I am not a huge fan of their rice and beans, which seem a bit bland to me.  But, the tacos, salsa and drinks all make up for some plain 'ol rice! \n\nI was very  happy to see a decent sized crowd here on my most recent visit and that La Condesa is applying for a liquor license.  This place needs to stick around for awhile!"

I liked the strong cinnamon flavor of the pork shoulder taco, but half the taco was enough.  The steak taco was good, juicy and not as sweet as the other food.  The chicken one (not mole) was ok, also too sweet.  I liked one or two bites of the chicken mole quesadilla, but couldn't have more than that, the sweet chocolate flavor became too strong.  I think that is what threw me, the food was almost dessert sweet. The mahi mahi burro was good, but I question the freshness of the mahi mahi, it was overly fishy, other than that it was very good.  So nothing was bad, the Hubby couldn't eat any of it after trying each, it was not his thing at all, but I would go back to try some other stuff.  My advice is to expect something different.  FIVE STARS + 100 more for the horchata though, ooohhhhhh my amazing!! The salsa bar was awesome also!!  Our service was good, and fast."

I would've hoped not, but my experience didn't seem to rate as high as expected. \n\nMy daughter and I met some friends here for a late lunch on a Saturday. The building isn't in the most amazing part of town, but I suppose it adds to the charm. The inside is small and very clean, and I was surprised to find that it's full service. According to older reviews, it was order at the window and grab a seat; a concept I would have preferred in this setting. \n\nThe salsa bar is expansive and varied, but I didn't find myself to be head over heels for any one in particular. Props for the creativity, but like another reviewer mentioned, I would rather have three killer salsas to choose from than several mediocre ones. Chips were included though, which was nice. \n\nWe each ordered an horchata ($4) and holy moses was it huge. Like, too huge. I couldn't finish half of it. It was pretty tasty and not overly sweet, but there was just too much of it. I would have appreciated the option for a smaller (and cheaper) amount.\n\nFor lunch we ordered the kiddies a Traditional Quesa ($7) to split, which happened to be a massive cheese-stuffed, deep-fried corn meal quesadilla. There was plenty of cheese, but also a ton of corn meal (eh, too much corn meal). \n\nAlso ordered was a taco combo plate ($8.79) with La Condesa Mahi Mahi and Carne Asada Tacos, a La Condesa Shrimp Taco, and Mole Burrito. The Mahi Mahi and Shrimp tacos were stuffed with an incredible amount of filler veggies and the Mahi Mahi was a bit dry. The Shrimp taco was flavorful and much better, I thought. The Carne Asada taco was dry and had little flavor. The beans were good, the rice just okay (I understand they're prepared \"traditionally\")...and were both served in TINY styrofoam containers on the side. For $8.79 a plate, it was totally not worth it. The Mole Burro was okay, but I think that's just because I'm not a huge fan of mole to begin with. Perhaps we ordered the wrong items, but I feel like it was pretty varied and nothing over-delivered. \n\n2 horchatas, a combo plate, one taco, one quesa and one burro set us back...drum roll please... $40 (not including tip). Definitely not what I'd call \"cheap street food\". Sure, they throw \"gourmet\" into the mix, but I'm not quite sure I'd call it that. Will I be back to La Condesa? Most likely not."

That's what we're good for (and to think we're trying to get rid of the Mexicans!).  There's awesome greasy hole-in-the-wall, everybody-speaks-Spanish places like El Tlacoyo and Moreno's in Mesa; there's a variety of fast food places like Filiberto's and Someburros; you have you generic family restaurant Mexican like Macayo's, Garcia's, and Tia Rosa's; and then you have your niche places.\n\nLa Condesa is one of those niche places, and one of my favorites.  Here, their niche is a slightly fancy take on really simple items like tacos, salsa, and quesadillas.  \n\nThe tacos come in several varieties, with meats including chicken, beef, pork, whitefish, and even dogfish shark, and different spices and toppings on each one.  My favorites are, of course, the shark, as well as the black mole, and one of the beef ones (not the Sonoran).\n\nThe salsas are also a big draw: prepare to be blown away as you dip your chips in peanut salsa, strawberry salsa, cilantro salsa, or even my personal favorite, pecan salsa.  There are typically about 20 choices, so if you want to try them all, come with a few friends (it does get crowded, though).\n\nThe quesadillas are also delicious; they're a southern Mexican fried style.  They're quite heavy, so don't plan on being able to eat two or three tacos *and* a quesadilla.\n\nOh...and GET THE HORCHATA.  You won't regret it.  I won't describe it, just because I don't want to ruin the surprise.  But it will blow your mind.  Whenever I get it, which is always, someone always asks me what that delicious-looking beverage is."

Our first visit we tried every taco on the menu... this time we tried a quesadilla, an Oaxacan Black Mole Burro, and for good measure a regular old bean burrito because we wanted to try their beans. On top of that I just had to get another 'Dogfish Shark' taco because it was my favorite, and instead of the Horchata we tried their Jamaica drink...mmm. \n\nThe quesadilla was very different, made with a really thick corn tortilla with sour cream drizzled all over it... damn good. Perfect to tear pieces off of and dip in the different salsas. The two burros we tried were equally tasty... and just like last time the chips were spot on. What's not to love about this place? It's just one of those 'easy to fall in love with' little holes in the wall. \n\nI think I'd give just about anything for them to start selling their salsa's to-go... especially after our last visit and finally being able to try the much talked about strawberry salsa; it really is as good as everyone says it is... heaven in a sauce basically. Whoever the mad scientist is behind these salsas really deserves a pat on the back, because I'm hooked. \n\nFrom what I've been hearing this place is slowly starting to get busier and busier... it puts a smile on my face to see good food and good businesses succeed based on word of mouth. In my ideal world there'd be a La Condessa on every other corner, instead of a Taco Bell... eh, baby steps I guess. 5/5."

        "review": "This place is HOT on Yelp for a reason. We couldn't wait any longer and had to go try it after reading so many awesome reviews this past month; and now we must personally thank every person who recommended this place to us:\n\nThank you my fellow Yelpers... if it weren't for you there is zero chance we ever would have stopped at this unassuming storefront in a pretty rough area of Central Phoenix. \n\nThis place has a very 'hole in the wall' sort of vibe... when we first pulled up we kind of had an \"Oh... this is it!\" sort of reaction. We got scared at first because there was a big 'public notice' sign on the front window; we thought it might have been shut down, but luckily it was just a 'liquor license pending' sign. Whew, that was close. It's a pretty small and cozy place inside. The walls are decorated with some really interesting and fun to look at Mexican paintings and the whole inside just feels authentic; like you just walked into a taco shop in a nice quaint Mexican village. The lady behind the counter and the cook that night were very welcoming and fun to talk to. Upon pondering one of the paintings on the wall she even explained to us the meaning behind it. \n\nFirst things first... the chips and salsa were flippin great! Thin and crispy with a slightly salted flavor; but even better than the chips are the salsas. I'm gonna go out on a limb here and say that La Condessa has got the best salsa in town; and the biggest variety too. Out off all the salsa's we tried a few standouts were the peanut, cilantro, and avocado variations. \n\nFor our main dish we got one of each taco on the menu... in the spirit of brevity I won't get into each specific taco; but I will say that we loved every single one of them. They each had very unique flavors with a sense of freshness to them, and pretty much zero grease. Each taco was also brim full with meat... they don't skimp on the product here; they give you your money's worth! Next time it might even be tempting to separate the two corn tortillas the tacos come in, and just divvy up the meat to make two tacos out of one! \n\nLast thing that must must must be mentioned is the Horchata. Generally this mysterious white drink is very hit and miss, well here it's a big time hit. It's unique and has all sorts of fresh fruits and spices floating in it... it tasted like some Super-Horchata or something; it was just absolutely to die for and is easily the best I've had. I highly recommend giving it a shot even if you usually don't like the stuff. \n\nLa Condessa gets a 4.5/5... rounded down to a 4 for now, just because we want to go back and try the rest of their menu; which at that time if it's anywhere near as good as our first visit this'll be bumped up to a solid 5 stars. Hooray for another great Mexican place in AZ!"

But still, I liked it just that much that I want to have my say anyway!\n\nI had one shrimp taco and one pibil taco.  The pibil was...... just... so, so so so good.  It made me want to exit through the kitchen and shoot the chef a la Johnny Depp (*i will not shoot any chefs, please do not report me).  The tortillas were just right, and I already want another one.\n\nThe shrimp taco.... I hate to say it but it WAS bland.  Not bad, just not very flavorful.  I poured on a bunch of the Cilantro Cream salsa, which didn't add much.  I'll stick with the pibil!\n\nOn to the salsas:  Believe the hype over this strawberry salsa.  Who the heck thinks these things up??  Regardless, it's brilliant and I hope they start selling it by the jar.  I was super excited about the cilantro cream, but it fell a little flat.  Like the shrimp tacos, it was good, just not filled with flavor.  The only other salsa I had was the plain old salsa, and it was really great as well.\n\nAnd as for the horchata, I have never had horchata like that.  It really was delicious, but just so sweet and rich that I don't think I even finished 1/4 of it.  And for some reason, you can't get a smaller size.  But for a few sips after your meal, mmmmmmmmmm.\n\nDave B is right about the price.  BUT, we each got 2 tacos, and neither one of us finished them both.  I really think that splitting a 2 taco meal, combined with the DELICIOUS tortilla chips, is more than enough for 2 people.\n\nAs others have mentioned, the artwork is just stunning.

Especially with a straw the diameter of an osmosis tube.  The crushed peanuts, and pecans, diced strawberry and cantalope are not straw friendly.  Especially for a traveller.  I kept probing the drink with my tiny tube, trying to find a crevice among the fracked fruit stand and ice, so I could slurp and taste some liquid.  Tough proposition caballeros.  If I'd have been at a table, with a spoon, my words might be celebrating the glories of this unique gourmet horchata.  \n\nMy favorite horchata in town is still Poblano's.\n\nI feast on art.

Lots of it is about humor, fleeting beauty, memorials, and kicking it in the hereafter.  I don't quite get it in my bones.  Some day I will.  I understand a Day of the Dead, but a lifetime of the dead is beyond me.  \n\nLa Condesa has Fine Art depicting The Dead.  Or those who could be dead.  I mean will be dead.

Looking over some of the Yelp* pictures, La Condesa is also a gallery.  \n\nTo the main course!\n\nThe salsa bar is the most diverse one I've seen.

Their mole could be a bit spicier for my taste but that's what the salsas are there for. I had the chicken mole as a taco and the pibil as a burro (separate occasion, alright, don't think I'm a pig now).\n\nIt's a great date place, I think. It's small, it's quaint, in a good neighborhood, and the satffers are very friendy. \n\nI love this place so much that I didn't even care about the tiny creature scurrying across the floor near the front door.

The flavor was amazing! a little heat, a little citrusy....mmm mmm mmm!!   Two of my co-workers had the Carne Asada and they both raved about it the whole way home. we all shared an Horchata for dessert -- wow!  very good too!  It's a big drink, so I do recommend sharing - it's totally worth it!    Their bellies were content before the long flight back to Espana!   \n\nThe portions were good.  Not too big, not too small.  Two tacos were filling - I always like to know what to expect.  Nobody had any leftovers, so I think the portions were just right.  \n\nOf course, the salsa bar is a key feature of this place.

Everything has been well prepared and fresh. The Mayan Cochinita Pibil in particular is drool-worthy. It's mildly sweet and super tender. Adding a little of the chipotle salsa really sets it off. \n\nAh, the salsa. There are some truly interesting varieties, from tamarind to pecan. The pecan salsa was a great surprise, with a nice amount of heat. It really sits well with the carne asada. \n\nMy only negative comment involves the parking situation. The parking lot is situated in such a way that in order to leave you have to back out onto 16th street. If a big ass SUV with tinted windows happens to park next to you (which always seems to happen) then pulling out can be...invigorating. \n\nLa Condesa now has a well earned spot of honor in my restaurant rotation."

The salsa bar is fantastic, and with so many choices (upwards around 10!) it was really hard to stick with four or five little cups.\n\nI decided to go kind of random with my taco selections and picked the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco and the Cochinita Pibil - marinated pork.  I seriously think the Cochinita Pibil was the best taco I've ever had, at least north of the border anyway.  The Dogfish Shark taco was very good as well.\n\nI think my search for the best tacos in Phoenix has come to a close!  It's going to be really tough to justify going to another place after this experience."

Plus, Plus, Plus. Salsa's were plenty, yes tried them all. But I'm a foodie and I need flavor, though I thought it's a bit on the bland side for my taste, I'll instead rave about them being unique and not your 'ordinary' mex-restaurant. The night we went, there was a line and busy, and they do treat you as family/friends (another Plus) but maybe too crowded. We had the center table and everyone, servers and patrons jammed right in there. \nI ordered up the Sonora Carne Asada Burrito (it says: A char-broiled mesquite Arrachera steak with homemade beans) unsure what Arrachera Steak is but gobbled it up with extra salsa from the buffet. Jodi had the Fish Tacos and well... they smelled fishy. Not the best either one of us ever had ...but was now check off our bucket list. Mission complete"

We each ordered a different  taco combo plate, one Aztec Tinga, one Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken,  one Baja Sur Dogfish Shark, and a quesadilla. \nAfter waiting a significant amount of time, the waitress brought out our quesadilla and one combo plate with one Aztec Tinga taco and one Oaxaca Black Mole Chicken taco. Despite going over our order numerous times with our server and another gentlemen, somehow, what we wanted seemed beyond comprehension. They brought out the Baja Sur Dogfish Shark taco combo plate and, after waiting so long and confusion over our order, we gave up and ate what we had.\nThe Azteca Tinga was superb. The Oaxaca Black Mole was good. The Baja Sur Dogfish wasn't really any better than your average fish taco. The rice is a white rice that had decent flavor and the same can be said for the flavor of the refried beans.\nLa Condesa has a great salsa bar, a cozy interior decorated with some great D\u00eda de los Muertos art. The staff was nice and friendly, despite the fact our order remained so elusive.\nBut, after the ordeal with our order and the less than stellar meal, I have to say that La Condesa was an utter disappointment."

They had some of the best homemade salsas with a large variety. From your classic Pico De Gallo to a Creamy Cilantro salsa. \n\nI ordered the two taco platter with a tinga taco and a carne asada Taco. These were both great. The carne asada was a little dry for my taste but with the assist of the homemade salsa's it was a perfect combo. The tinga taco was a perfect combination of slowly cooked shredded chicken and seasoning. My colleague got a carne asada burrito and a tinga taco and was satisfied by both. \n\nIn short if I am looking for a great taco for a good price I am going back to La Condesa."

But now I have, and I'm not sure that I can go back to the soft-drinky stuff of various fill-in-the-blank-bertos.\n\nThey could start a lucrative business just selling that horchata, but the food is amazing as well. My friends and I slid through the door about half an hour before closing, and were immediately greeted with menus and chips. We ordered, then proceeded to raid the salsa bar. It wasn't at its full glory at the end of the night, but 'twas still extensive. Honestly, I'm kind of a ho when it comes to condiments, so trust me when I say we looted that baby. Hard. I can't pick a favorite, but I was particularly fond of the avocado-cilantro, as well as the chipotle salsa. \n\nThem tacos is the stuff of dreams. Layered corn tortillas, rich and steamy chicken mole, fresh onions y cilantro. For all of a few minutes, I was in heaven. And then I was in a food coma. Two tacos don't sound like much, but it is definitely a good amount of food. Especially if you've been sucking the life out of your horchata.\n\nService was fast and friendly, the dining area was clean and pleasant, and I am officially crowning La Condesa my favorite taco shop of all time. Big words coming from a California girl, I know, but I wasn't even drunk when I went. (FYI, I got drunk after... and it all stayed down!) I will be back, La Condesa.

She blew me off, but I was so looking forward to it, I talked two other friends into joining me to check out a new spot.\n\nThe gal is a jamiaca fiend, and was thrilled with the drink.  Having read reviews on the size of the horchata, I convinced the guy to share one with me, we could always get another if we needed it.  (We didn't)  WOW - no other horchata will ever measure up!\n\nYes, the salsa bar ROCKED!  We sampled 6 or 7 of them.  I could live off the jicama, cilantro, jalepeno and lime tastiness!  And the hot red one that looked greasy had the most amazing heat/flavor ratio I could imagine ever encountering.  Truly, the acme salsa!\n\nBeing indecisive, I went a la carte with the tacos.  One each of the cochinita pibil, one chicken mole and one carne asada.\nI was busy having a foodgasm with the cochinita when the gal freaked on her carne asada, making the guy have some - and they both agreed it is better than America's Taco Shop!  (Mine had to sit and wait while I was having quality alone time with the last bites of the pork.)\n\nI will say I wasn't thrilled with the mole.  This is NOT a knock on how La Condesa does it - and if you're a mole fan, it may be amazing.  I'd never actually had mole - turns out I am just not a fan of the overall flavor.  But I love almost all Mexican food, and I love chocolate!  How is this possible!  Two rights making a wrong?  Weird!\n\nThat said...I will be back.  Over and over!

You'd have to know where it is though, because the tourists are not going to accidentally stumble upon it.  It's in the middle of the hood in Phoenix.  The only thing setting it apart from the other old-school business fronts with barred windows is the giant mosaic Day of the Dead Catrina above the door.\n\nKnown as a \"gourmet taco place\" to locals, the menu also features burros and quesadillas.  Where else can you get a shark soft taco or a Mahi Mahi burro?  I have no idea, but you can get them here.  My husband loved his Mahi Mahi burro.\n\nI had a more traditional Carne Asada soft taco.  All their flour tortillas are hand made, and fresh.  And did I mention the salsa bar?  About 20 different kinds of salsa for you to try, with the chips that keep coming to the table.  My favorite was the creamy cilantro one.  There are also peanut and pecan based salsas, so those with nut allergies, take note.  You may not expect nuts in your food, so pay attention.\n\nSeating is limited, (maybe 10 tables) and the restaurant was full when we were there, for lunch, in the middle of the week.  If you have a group larger than 4, it would probably be wise to call ahead.  Parking is also limited, just the few spaces on the street in front.\n\nThe only slightly disconcerting element was the giant mural of Frida Khalo.  It's a little odd to be stared at by a giant portrait of a mustached woman while eating such wonderful food.\n\nWe liked it so much that my husband took my dad there.  My dad is a notoriously finicky eater (which means I probably came by it naturally), and he is still talking about it a week later.  Yum!"

We agreed that it can be hard to make vegetarian food flavorful at times. She liked the salsa bar because she could add a different flavor between bites.\n\nThey get slammed on weekends.

You lightly crunch through the batter & the tender dogfish practically, no perfectly, falls apart in your mouth. I'm addicted.\n\nThe Shrimp Quesa is... gosh, where do I even start?

It's amazing how a little thing like sliced garlic makes a huge difference in flavor balance.\n\nI thought I'd had some darn good horchata before. This is horchata on steroids.

The rave reviews on Yelp won me over so I decided to recommend this place to a friend so we could meet up for lunch.\n\nLuckily I snagged a spot right out front at 1pm but I'm not sure where the additional parking was? Upon entering, the place has some cute decor but it was a little startling to walk in and see that it's pretty small inside and it was busy. With no hostest stand, I immediately had that, 'deer in headlights look' about what to do and where to go but I was recognized when I walked in within a few seconds and luckily there was a table for two open. While I was recognized and that was a relief, I wasn't greeted per say but was just asked if there would only be one for lunch. I said I was waiting for a friend so luckily they sat me without her being there. The water came around and gave me small plastic Solo cup full for water and menus. I've never seen solo cups like this in a restaurant? Maybe it's for the lunch crowd? I noticed all the other tables had larger drinks, also in plastic cups, so maybe it was just for your drinks to go?\n\nAnyway, my friend arrived a few minutes later and after we got caught up on our week and looked over the menu, I had to flag down our waiter to order. I attempted to order the grapefruit margarita that I had heard rave reviews about but the waiter didn't understand 'Grapefruit Margarita' and offered some fruity one with melon and something else. When I confirmed that it didn't have grapefruit and he offered another one, again without grapefruit, I opted just to forget it and drink the water. I figured I would fill up on chips and salsa so I went with two al la cart tacos. My friend ordered a mahi mahi bowl. I was pretty impressed with their chips, not overly thick like some places and pretty light and the the 6-7 salsas we tried were mostly good. I wasn't aware there was a need for peanut salsa? It was definitely different but not something I needed to try twice. My favorites were the creamy white one (can't remember the name) and the strawberry salsa one. You go help yourself to the salsa bar once they bring the chips but it looked like you had to pay extra for an extra bowl of chips since they were on their special of the day board for $2. Also, the salsa bar had small dipping cups to eat the salsa. They're about the size of the to-go dressing cups you get in other restaurants but not quite as deep. Again, they were plastic so it kinda took away from the overall feel of the meal. I'm all for convenience and I know this probably cuts down on the customers filling up larger containers and wasting salsa...and doing dishes...but I would think there has to be a more environmentally and more aesthetic way to do this? Granted, this is no fancy Mexican place but they seemed to put effort in the decor so maybe that's where they spent all their money on rather than real dishes? It definitely did discourage me from going back for seconds though so maybe that was their goal?\n\nOur food came and both my tacos were really good. The presentation was nice, no plastic there! The tortillas were fresh and all ingredients seemed quality. My friend said her dish was really good and she got a really big portion. \n\nWe enjoyed our meal but our waiter never returned. A young kid, maybe 8 or 10, came over and asked to take our plates and he asked if there was anything else we needed. I requested the bill thinking he would tell our waiter that we were ready for the check. I'm guessing this is a family owned place so I understand everyone pitching in but the kid then delivered our check and then took our credit cards to pay for the bill! Our waiter was standing back at the register, almost watching over him though, but I still wasn't overly eager about handing over my card to such a young kid. He was at least faster than our waiter though so I guess it was okay.\n\nI really don't mean to harp on this place because the food was good. Just a few more things done differently and I could see this being a go-to spot for me. For now, it doesn't top my list of places I have to come back to soon."

They have the classic fare of pico, but they have so much more than that... when I say a bar, there are at least 10 impressive salsas to choose from that are freshened frequently.  My favorite, the roasted seven chili salsa; let me tell you I wanted to run into the back and take every last remaining bit of it and run home to enjoy it in solitude.  Seriously though, all of the salsas are incredible... but the seven chili is just the best... dont try debating me, your arguments will fall on deaf ears.  ;)\n\nThe guacamole is earth shattering. It has mango, cranberries, avocado and other ingredients that just just take the ordinary and make it extraordinary.\n\nThe main course... Pibil Burro...\n\nJenny B mentioned the movie \"Once Upon a Time in Mexico\" where Johnny Depp's character had a very passionate love for pibil.  I cannot say enough about the pibil.  From my experience at this restaurant I am sure everything on the menu is amazing, but from my point of view the pibil is where it is at.  Get it, love it, devour it and embrace it for all its glory.  Yeah... I am a fan.\n\nAt the heart of this amazing place on 16th Street is a staff that is no less than stellar.  The people that work here are so incredibly friendly and take every opportunity to make sure you are enjoying your experience.

The quality and size of their tacos surpasses that of America's (Sorry America's Taco Shop lovers) and it adds a strong local cultural vice that other taco shops lack with its Dia de los Muertos themed paintings. The meat is well-marinated (especially the carne asada) and the dozen-plus salsas are each different by tasty and made to perfection. You can spend ten-to-fifteen minutes just sorting through the salsa bar. I am lucky enough to live nearby and I take advantage of the shark tacos on most days :) I am so glad that it's caught on! I know that I will keep coming back!!!"

Had the carne asado tacos which are fresh and tasty.\n\nThe thing that stands out here is the salsa bar with the different varieties of salsa to choose from. Fresh and home made with a great opportunity to experiment and sample all kinds.\n\nVery small place with old tables and dawn of the dead motif if that is your thing. Service is good but they dont have much to do with you. The parking is limited and may need to park along a side street.\n\nYou order at the counter and they bring the food to you. Simple and easy\n\nRecommend to try their tacos if you want real tacos and something different"

The Shark Taco was good until I ran into a huge piece that was so tough that I couldn't get my teeth to sink into it.\nThe carne asada tacos meat was a bit tough and cold.\nThe pork taco was pretty good and the meat was tender.\n\nThe salsa bar was the most interesting and yummy thing in the place. I loved the cilantro salsa the most.\n\nIf you go there you may want to pick a time when it's a little more busy. Not sure if my food was at its best since it was just before dinner? Not sure. I will give it another try though. Each taco was about 3.50 each. There are a lot better taco joints in the area though."

The place is super small and kind of divey. They have a salsa bar for you to enjoy when you first sit down. The strawberry salsa was my favorite. Sweet but a little bit spicy. They definitely get you on the chips though because there are no free refills like most other places. Another basket of chips is almost $3. I got the chicken mole quesadilla. Their quesadillas are definitely not like your typical quesadilla. It's almost like a deep fried calzone. The portion is huge though, I could only eat half of it. My bf got one shark taco to try and it was kind of disappointing. It tasted like cod and there wasn't very much flavoring. The taco just came with a tiny bit of lettuce and some green sauce. We got the guacamole and it was delicious. They put raisins and some other fruit in it. At first it sounds strange but trust me, it's so good. Wish we saved some chips to eat with it since we ate most of it with the salsa. The service is friendly and the food came out pretty quick. I'm glad we tried it out but don't know if I would be dying to go back."

I disagreed, but that evening, I just so happened to bike over to La Condesa to try out this new gourmet taco place on 16th.\n\nThe cursive red neon sign, that word \"gourmet\" and the dozens of Yelp endorsements ushered us in on a Tuesday night.  Warm walls. Original paintings. Furnishings from Bellas Artes de Mexico.  The most substantial wooden tables and chairs in central Phoenix.  When we had opportunity in our conversation to \"knock on wood,\" we felt a bit shamed by the feebleness of our gesture and the robustness of the table.  Order at the counter from a cheerful and demure young lady, whose accent we could not place.\n\nI linger on the ambiance because others have noted the stellar food.\n\nYour food food for thought:  Come for the two taco meal (with beans & rice (with corn!)), and stay for the fresh and diverse salsa bar.  This isn't Baja Fresh.  This is Condesa cuisine.  Think jicama and orange salsa.  Think peanut salsa. And the creamiest, zingiest cilantro creme salsa!\n\nI must disagree with Lali about the beans: America's Tacos' are more memorable, but you are still right, Lali, on a technicality -- the beans at America's are not pinto...It's a secret. Not really. Ask them."

Luckily I didn't get towed. Parking is not so fantastic there and you have to drive slowly down the street so you don't miss it. The restaurant is in a non-descriptive block. \nWhen I walked in, I loved the big wood chairs and tables. The feel was authentic mexican inside. We grew up going to Mexico every family vacation and my parents always liked to go to the non-touristy spots, especially in Cancun downtown. This restaurant reminded me of the Yucatan-inspired restaurant we visited that was right next to the bull fighting arena. So did some of the items on the menu. There was a mini bar for the salsas, and I think they had about 6 out. I wish they put a name card out for them so you knew what they were. I decided to grab a few different ones and see which I liked best. None of them were outstanding, but I did enjoy the unique, but hot strawberry salsa. I  decided to try a corn quesadilla off the menu, looking forward to real mexican queso in my meal. I ordered the Mayan Cochinita Pibil Quesa. It had Oaxaca cheese, roasted pork shoulder with achiote rojo and Mexican herbs. It was delicious, though, it was so filling, I could only eat half.  I was unhappy about the tortilla chips.  They tasted old and stale. I figured they'd be fresh and hot from the fryer since I got there right when they opened. \nI need to go back again so I can really get a feel for more of the food and atmosphere.

We were the first table in on Sunday and were greeted right away by our server and felt at home with its cozy interior.  It's a small place but has lots of character with the heavy solid wood and wrought iron furniture.  Love the Dia de Los Muertos art and heavy wood bar with cowhide bar stools and authentic Mexican glassware.\n\nWe sampled quite a few of the salsas at the salsa bar and there is a little something for everyone including those that can't take a lot of spice.  This is a big plus for us since our family has spice tolerances from 1 to 10+.\n\nWhat was on our menu? we tried the divorced eggs (which I added avacado), black mole chilaquiles with chicken, and an egg scramble with side of bacon; all of which were served with black beans.... Delicious and full of flavor! I'll have to post the brunch menu next time since it is not currently on their website.\n\nEach of us would order the same thing again, but so want to try the other items of delicousness on their menu.\n\nI guess we will have to make La Condesa a staple on our restaurant list!"

The cheese in the tacos is delicious. The beans and rice were great too. \n\nI had their house margarita which was so different and refreshing.

Only a couple bucks but I wish I was warned before I saw it on the receipt. \n\nAlso, I saw a tiny bit of unidentifiable meat in my taco. It must have gotten mixed in accidentally on the grill.

I mean, this place is supa close to me, so I'm happy, but I really wish this place had a sexy downtown location because it is so freaking good it would blow up if more people were near it. I feel the location, although keeps it a hidden gem, also repells people from going, although let me be the one to tell you, it shouldn't! You NEED to go here if you are chippy and salsa person. Bottom line. Not optional. The absolute BEST in Phoenix metro ever. If you disagree, hit me up and I will pay for your meal. I'm not kidding. I believe in it that much. \n\nThe good: The Salsa bar. Jesus Christ himself would call this Salsa bar a miracle. From reds, to greens, to peanut, to hot, to mild, chunky and smooth they have everything, hand made from scratch and incredible. The flavors actually rotate so some times you'll go and get a new treat to try. Most of them are inspired by regions of the world and have salsa flares about them. I can't stop, thinking about it now. I may leave this coffee shop and go there for lunch today now... \n\nThe gourmet tacos. Incredible, large chuncks of savor steak, giant shrimp (yah I know that makes no sense), and great corn tortillas make this no flour boy a very very happy camper. \n\nObviously you'll need to choose the right salsa to add on top of your already incredibly delicious taco, but choose wisely. The flavors are already perfect. \n\nI hope this review has done it justice. It's incredible and needs to be in your rotation.

BUT there were no forks (we had to eat with spoons and fingers).  There were no napkins, and the salsa bar was bone dry.  I mean the salsa trays looked like they had been licked clean by a starving dog.  They were able to replenish the salsa but they completely ran out of forks.  We got no chips and no drinks.  We had to beg the poor, nice girl who was completely stressed out.  They were a tad understaffed.

Crusty bits of steak that had a crunchy sear but were still very tender on the inside.

Trying to squeeze into one of their small tables I almost knocked one of their priceless works of art that are just hanging balanced on a nail. \nIf the chef can mature and work on some of his experimental flavors this little eatery should have customers for years. \nHowever if they continue to operate under such cramped conditions people will stop coming in just because of the logistics."

        "review": "Third visit to La Condesa and that's enough to give it a review. I like the flavors, which are largely guided by your personalized salsa choices, but find it to be a bit heavy in portions.\n\nLa Condesa is really ALL about the salsa... not just for the chips but utilizing the bar during the whole visit to create your own perfect balance of flavors. Dishes are dialed into a low volume in order to let the salsa sing.  If your meal's not right, it may be that you're putting peanut salsa on charred beef rather than chicken or vegetables.\n\nPORTIONS + VALUE\nTwo Condesa tacos are way too generous, while three truly street-sized tacos at Gallo Blanco are just perfect for this gal (one reviewer noted the lack of a \"sampler\" style plate, which is true). However my brother in law, the bottomless pit, packed away one queso and two tacos in a single sitting. So if you're a big eater and looking for value, its very fair and you'll get plenty of protein.\n\nTHE BEANS\nSmooth, smoky, with just a little chunk. Thin enough for dipping, which is crucial for the doughy ends of your fried queso tortilla. I'm impressed at how consistent the beans have tasted across three visits. Portion size has been reviewed as small but when you have that much taco to eat, who has room for beans other than as a condimento?\n\nTHE RICE\nNothing to write home about. Pale, underseasoned. On one visit it was sticky. Not what we local eaters expect as \"Mexican Rice\".\n\nTHE SALSAS\nThis is what you come for: salsa on demand. There is an avocado cruda salsa that disappears quickly but is consistently green and fresh, never gray. Chile de arbol salsa has a faint nutty taste. Green tomatillo is delicious. Purple cabbagy condimento is great paired with cochinita as suggested. Salsa Mexicana is not mundane. Cilantro drizzle is a welcome accent. \n\nTACOS\nTaco plates are generously portioned with meat, almost too much in my book but who's complaining? Whisper of selected vegetable garnish included. Tortillas are average quality and may not be steam-fluffed enough. I'll give them this: they don't break. \n\nBURRITOS\nMessy but good. Thin wax paper can't withstand much contact with a knife and fork. The Bullet is a mild no-brainer favorite for kids. \n\nQUESOS\nDecadent! Sinful! Beckoning! The fried dough is pastry-like. Paired with the cohinita pibil it was like having dessert for supper. The extra doughy bits on the seam are particularly yummy dunked in beans. Being a fan of the doughy huarache concept in general, the Queso takes corncake-ness up to eleven.\n\nMOLE NEGRO\nA true mole negro, not the sweeter raisin-y ancho-packed type we often get here in town. It's not smoky, but actually charred and a little bitter, with aromatic undertones. Chocolate tones not easily discernable. Different that what you may be used to, but good.\n\nAZTEC CHICKEN TINGA\nAdequately wet and seasoned. Tender and easy to pull apart without a knife. Mild on the seasoning, but easily remedied with that ample salsa bar everyone is raving about. This makes Mexican food accessible to all tolerances of heat, in a way.\n\nCOHINITA PIBIL\nDelicate shreds of well braised pork. Low key on the seasoning but not flavorless. Nice paired with the purple salsa and anything acidic they have out that day.\n\nSEAFOOD\nOur bottomless pit had the Ahi and the Dogfish shark and said both were good.\n\nCARNE ASADA\nCrunchy but missing the smoke and sizzle I'd expect from a mesquite grilled specialty. It was adequate but lacked a bit of citrus acidity and kick. Competent, and even tasty.  Again, nothing not easily remedied by salsa.\n\nVEGETABLES\nHow refreshing to have vegetables available for all dishes as entree or add-ons. I added spinach to my Queso in a meager attempt to satisfy a vegetable serving for my meal. It delivered beautifully and added crunch.\n\nBEVERAGES\nHorchata and Jaimaica live up to their previous reviews here. Horchata is way too huge for a child. Would love to see a pint-sized version. The full size is a commitment.\n\nTHE WAIT\nYes, you might wait. Even if the restaurant is empty. I went for take-out after the lunch rush and waited 20 minutes even though there was only one order ahead of me and there was no line at the counter.  If I had known they were going to pack me a mini-stash of chips in the to-go bag I'd have asked for it in advance to pass the time at the salsa bar while I waited. Post-lunch rush also showed some empty salsa bins but with 12 choices, it just means some of your favorites are in the process of being refilled. We're spoiled here at La Condesa. Most of my favorite true-mex restaurants only offer two, maybe three at the table.\n\nTHE ENVIRONMENT\nRustic contemporary/ironic and clean on the surface but not tidy to the  glance when abandoned baskets stack up. They need a self-service trash can like Baja Fresh or Chipotle so the baskets don't accumulate in public view. Would appreciate a commitment to wash cheap silverware. No indication if they recycle the consumables."

Call it whatever you want, just find the place.  It's so good, my friends and I came here twice during our trip, on the word of some locals we met at JoBot Coffee.  It's a really small place, so expect a wait unless you happen to get lucky and pop in at a slow time.  The guacamole is stupid good, as are the shark and pork tacos.  If you're really hungry, skip the 2 taco platter (just adds rice and beans) and get a third taco, or order the guac."

I, personally, have never had a problem with any of their waitresses and only once has my food been mixed up (whatever, accidents happen).\n\nLook- the food here is good. I for one HATE mole, but a friend of mine ordered it here (I think it was in taco form) and I had a bite and I was like \"heyyyyyy. not baaaaad.\" That says a lot about the quality of their food. \nThey have AMAZING quesadillas. They're not your typical filibertos \"I'm gonna throw some day old cheese inside this tortilla\" quesadillas. No. They deep fried corn quesas filled with deliciousness. I personally love the steak & cheese quesa. It comes topped with sour cream and fresh cotija cheese. Try dipping it in their pecan salsa.\n\nGET A HORCHATA! You won't be disappointed. It's homemade and they add melons, strawberries and walnuts into the mix. All those flavors pair so well together. It's the best horchata I have ever had.\n\nThey have an awesome salsa bar. I would guess there are at least 20 kinds of salsa in there. I also saw people complaining on yelp about their chips. I've been here a bunch of times and never received stale chips. Here's a tip people- If you get something you don't like... tell them! I'm sure they will gladly bring you another basket of FREE chips.\n\nThe ONLY, and I mean only, reason they are losing a star from me is because on my very first visit (a little over a year ago) they had a DELICIOUS strawberry salsa that I absolutely loved. I have since returned many many times and NO STRAWBERRY SALSA. I asked one of the ladies who work there when they were going to have it again and she told me she didn't know. I guess I'm just disappointed because it was SO GOOD and kind of the main reason I even went back the second, third and fourth times. But the rest of their food is still super delicious and I will continue to go here and eat up all their delicious drinks and salsas."

But then you realize that amazing salsa bar at the back of the restaurant is where you get to pick out your salsa! My favorite was the strawberry salsa it was so unique, I've never had something like that before- and it was fresh fresh fresh! Then there's other usual salsas and more fun ones, probably about 12 or 14 to choose from and lots of lemons and limes.\n\nI had the tinga chicken tacos and they were very spicy, but I like spicy! But if you don't like spicy do not order them, they have an after burn and don't require salsa. The amount of chicken on the two taco plate was amazing for $6.99! \n\nTIPS-\n\nTry the strawberry salsa\n$2.00 Modelo Sat&Sun\nHappy hour M to F 3 to 6 looks great"

There were rumors about La Condesa: awesome salsa bar, tasty cheap tacos...I am glad to say that both of those rumors are TRUE!\n\nI had a chicken mole taco which had just a couple too many red onions on it (which were easily dispatched). The mole was rubbed into the chicken rather than glooped on top, so the fragrant smokiness really soaked into the chicken. I liked this taco even better with a spoonful of the juicy strawberry salsa on top.\n\nI also sampled the carne asada burro. Simple handmade flour tortilla (I could eat them plain for days), filled with black beans and beef. The meat had a deep flavor and was slow-cooked tender. Again, a dollop from the large assortment of salsas, this time the creamy cilantro, made good taste great.\n\nMy calabacitas were grilled just right: nice char marks, but with some body still left to the slices. \n\nLa Condesa only loses a point because the chips could have been better (fresher) and the parking in front is rather harrowing. Otherwise, it is going in the regular rotation. I hope they have t-shirts sometime soon with some of the amazing artwork!"

The servers were quick to take our order despite being busy and minutes later my tacos de arrachera arrived. Sooo good! I mean. Wow! Meat was tender and juicy ....and the combination of spices and flavors was heaven. My friend ordered the Condesa specialty taco. Another winning ticket! Condesa has nailed the right way to make beans too. And..don't get me started on the deliciousness of the horchata. I've had me some horchata many places ..but this really rocked my world.

Its a very small venue, no bathroom, so make sure to wash your hands and do your business before you get there. Only about a dozen or so tables on the floor, and the cashier is also your waitress delivering food to your table. If your expecting great service, forget about it, you focus strictly on the food here. Their is barely any parking. Everyone that seemed to come in was new to this place checking out other patrons food and asking them what it is and how they like it. Im sure they were all fellow yelpers as well considering where this place is and how everyone appeared to be new to this place.\n\nThe address is a little confusing with the map being shown on their website. Its off 16th street as the address implies, and the crossroad is Palm and 16th. There is a sign for another business there that says FAT PAD which is easily visible. Blink and you will miss this restaurant. The inside has a lot of cool mexican art. They also have a fresh salsa bar.\n\nWow this has some very flavorful food. Its not greasy or fatty at all. You can really taste all the ingrediants. I ordered the Dog Fish Tacos, the mahi mahi burrito, and the Carne Asada Taco. Everything was absolutely delish with lots of flavor! I liked the Dog Fish taco best. \n\nMake sure to get there before noon. They do take a while to make it, so be sure you have the time, especially if they are busy. You can call ahead or fax your order in as well."

I tried the mahi mahi (grilled, I'm not sure if there is a fried version) and the veggie taco. Hmm, they are both equally good; I can't pick one over the other. I can say that the Pecan salsa helped out the fish taco with a nice spiciness and gave it that pizzazz it needed to set it apart. \n\nThis is my first visit to La Condesa so, I'm not sure how the place works, but from what I gather you just walk-in and grab a seat then a server will eventually get to you. It was a Sunday evening when we stopped by and there was only 1 SERVER!!! Poor thing was running all over the place. I don't blame her for not getting to us with the first few minutes we sat down. After a little bit she regained her composure and was friendly and accommodating. She really shouldn't of been the only person serving the place was hopping as one group left another entered. There was no one standing around waiting for a place to sit, and honestly I don't know where they would wait. \n\nThe paintings on the walls are amazing. Great art work to look at. However, I was seated at the bar and faced empty bar shelves and the light above me was out, so it was very dim. So as far as ambiance, it just wasn't quite working for me. \n\nBack to the food.. The refried beans could use some improvement. Okay, so I am Hispanic and have been eating beans since birth and I have never had beans so watered down. It was more of a cold bean soup. Maybe that's what La Condesa was going for, but that didn't work for me either. The rice was good and warm.  \n\nI enjoyed the salsa bar. So many salsas, Cilantro (like), Pico (like), Pecan (like), Peanut, Mexican (like), the list goes on!!\n\nI would visit this place again with the hopes that I get a table next time!"

        "review": "Two words: salsa bar. At any given time you go to La Condesa, they'll have about 15ish different types of salsa that you can pick from to eat with your complimentary chips. This is dangerous because you have the ability to fill up on chips before you get to your meal, so be careful! My personal favorites are the pican salsa, strawberry salsa, and chipotle salsa. \n\nI tend to order the same things over and over when I go to a restaurant, and I just can't get away from the fish, veggie, and shark tacos. Their chicken mole taco is also to die for. I would recommend ordering a 2 taco plate with rice and beans and selecting 2 tacos to sample. If you think you'll fill up on chips and salsa, don't order the rice and beans, but I think that they are a nice compliment to the taco plate. \n\nThe first time I ordered a house margarita here, it came out way to sweet, they were heavy handed with the triple sec I think. I tried it again a different time and they had toned it down, and it was actually quite delicious. I'm used to a simple margarita that's just lime juice, agave, and tequila, and this is definitely not a simple marg. But, it's still pretty tasty. \n\nSome people may think this is in a sketchy neighborhood, and it is in \"the barrio,\" but I've never felt unsafe going either here or Barrio Cafe up the street. So stop being a pansy and go eat some tacos."

I ordered a Pepsi and it didn't taste like it had sugar at all so I returned it and the girl gladly exchanged it and didn't give me any beef about it, she was so chatty friendly and witty and she recommended the Cochinita Pibil Quesadilla, and I said oh hell why not? Lets have it as an appetizer while I waited for my friend to get there, well was I in for a big surprise! It was ORGASMIC, with some of the best cochinita pibil I have ever had in my entire life, so warm and with the perfect level of spicyness, I even added one of the hot salsas on top to the quesadilla, it was even more delicious after that, and the queso fresco it had on top was just to die for. \nI was actually way too full to even finish the quesadilla, and way too full to even order one of their delicious tacos which according to my friend, were also orgasmic. I cannot wait to go back and will definitely become a repeat customer.\nFYI, the girl told us that they are supposed to have a bar soon, but in the meantime, each guest is allowed to bring a beer into the establishment.

Unfortunately I never really got to try either b/c they had run out pretty much out of all of it.  Probably a good sign that they are busy and popular but at the same time, a big disappointment.  I tried their two taco plate.  The cochinita pibil and veggie tacos.  Both were ok.  The beans were ok but not nearly as good as America's homemade beans.  The rice was like everyone said - not your typical mexican rice.  Not bad though.  Apparently they were so busy they could barely keep up with \"supply\".  The salsa bar was pretty dismal.  They had just a little of the cilantro and peanut one.  Horchata was all out.   I'm disappointed that I missed out but at least it's a good sign that they are the place to go.

It's easy to pass by this as it's squeezed in between a closed down car repair shop and a Mexican party shop, complete with pinatas hanging outside.  The only giveaway is the fact that however nice your ride is, there's at least two other vehicles here way classier parked beside you.  You open a large wooden door to a cacaphony of fantastic smells, dizzied by this olfactory blast and pupils adjusting to the darkened lighting, and stumble to find an open table to sit down at.  The furniture is all heavy wood an iron, a signifier of the quality of the place, but the placing is not the best, leading to endless bumping and apologies, the only thing that could be considered a bad point to this place.\n\nIf you love salsa, this place hosts a bar with at least ten different types of salsa including ones made from ground pecans, which became addicting after the initial shock of eating salsa made from nuts.  It's hard to find for those coming with quite an appetite I recommend the Santos Plate.  It's a choice of one taco, one burrito and a generous helping of grilled zucchini.  \n\nI tend to slather anything I get in salsa to raise the spice level, the chicken tinga in a burrito does not require it at all, by the end of this huge burrito I was starting to feel sweat droplets forming but I couldn't pull away from how delicious it was.  The taco choice recommendation is the pork shoulder cooked in banana leaves, the flavor was amazing and the red vinegared topping added just the perfect amount of sweet and sour.  I'm not a big fan of chocolate but if you are, the mole taco will definitely hit those key notes with you as well.\n\nI've never personally ordered the horchata but one of my co-workers did.  It only comes in one size, LARGE.  Be very thirsty and take your insulin beforehand.  Thirty-two ounces awaits of what was originally horchata, now spiced with cinnamon and nutmeg, ground pecans and strawberry.  Definitely not your average rice drink.\n\nOverall you can't go wrong here, everything is made fresh, hot and delicious.  This place has become a monthly ritual spot, it should be for you as well."

So we stood around awkwardly trying to decide to sit at one of the dirty 2 tops or take a bigger one. There were only two occupied tables when we arrived on a Saturday night. Finally someone came out and waved us to a table, and, in the end, we ordered seated (no \"order here\" sign either).\n\nWhen people say it's tiny, they really mean, \"this is almost NYC style sit on top of each other or at least have a hard time winding your way between tables\".\n\nBut let's get down to the food... I had the fish taco and the carne taco. Both were ok. If you're looking for fancy toppings, move along. You get some shredded cabbage from a bag on top of your tacos. That's it. So you have to take advantage of the salsa bar, which is fine. I got the combo, so the rice and beans were included. And they were awesome. The rice was light and fluffy and the beans were amazing.\n\nHubby had the cochinita pibil burro. We joked that it wouldn't taste nearly as good as the stuff cooked underground in banana leaves but we were so wrong. If food could give you an orgasm, this would do it. Just beans (those super smooth beans again!) and meat in here, and the meat is to die for. Super juicy and flavorful.\n\nAnd everyone drinking out of giant cups? Yah, it's the horchata. And yah, at $3.99 it's pricey, but it's also the best I've had anywhere. Save it for dessert, because it is that good.\n\nSo the service was \"eh\" (they were scraping chairs along the floor and bumping into me constantly as they rearranged for a large party coming in) and the music was loud but kept cutting out. So why five stars? It was the pork, man, and the horchata. I would stop by for just those two things, and then die happy."

We returned our horchata for being too thin and tasteless, and you brought us new ones after we finished eating. You drizzled a pretty crema all over the top of my torta (sorry, lonche). How do I pick it up and eat it? \n\nIn the past we forgave the dirty tables and loudness because your cochinita pibil was pure bliss. But not even that makes up for the service. :("

While eating with a friend from Tucson, he recognized the art on the walls as being the art of famous San Francisco artist Sylvia Ji.   So we called the owner over to ask about the artist.  She told us all the art was by Mexican artists Manuel Gilavalos y Garcia and Ricardo Ramirez.   These are obvious reproductions of a young artist who is currently very hot and exhibiting all over the world.   How has La Condesa gotten away from this for so long?      \n\nThe owners probably have no idea, but this is some shameful shit, and as great of a reproduction as it looks and makes the little restaurant feel,  Sylvia should be notified and should cease and desist on these \"artists\".      Google Sylvia Ji  and check the La Condesa website and compare the art, and you'll see what Im talking about.   One of the paintings in there is an EXACT replica of one of her paintings."

I ordered the Aztec Tinga Taco, and they were very good. The salsa's were all great. The service was great, and the waitress apologized for the chips, and stated that they had ran out and had to buy some etc, etc..

But best of all... for 2 tacos, a little side of rice and beans, chips, two BIG drinks, it was only $16! Plus, we listened to The Smiths and old Mexican folk music. This place rocks. Oh, and for those reviewers who were frightened by the neighborhood, get over it. I live 5 blocks in a historic neighborhood and it is as safe as a city can get.

My favorite was their tomatillo salsa.  \n\nI ordered the Oaxaca Mole taco and a carne asada taco.  The mole was excellent with great flavor.  The carne asada was bland and flavorless...huh?

Showing up with my customary crew of three little boys, you can imagine some people would be annoyed, but our hostess greeted us kindly and found us the space to sit down. They didn't mind at all that we had to park the stroller at the small bar.\nThe boys were hungry monsters and we got baskets of chips right away. I found several lovely non spicy salsas for the boys, including a pecan salsa, cilantro salsa, and strawberry salsa. We ordered a mole taco, shark taco, and pibil taco with a side of rice and beans to share among us. It was plenty for two adults, two little ones and a very picky 8 yr old who just ate chips. Each taco was awesome.each was  Realy  unique in flavors. The beans and rice were both boring and bland. All salsas were delicious. It almost didnt m atter what we ate because it was all so delish.\nThe decor was very appealing, although the walls were pretty dirty. The service was good, the music good and rather loud, which helped to drown out the baby pulverizing chips with his fists. This is not wat I would categorize as a good place to take kids, but even so, they were tolerated, and I am just not going to miss trying a place like this because I have my kids with me. \nThe only drawback for me was that this is a SMALL place, and it was hot and airless inside. I don't know if the air conditioning was broken, but just a room fan would have helped a lot. We were sweating by the end of the meal, and not from the pico de gallo. I hope they get that worked out before summer melts the asphalt."

It's completely out of my way but boy was it worth it.\n\nI ordered two things:\nCarne asada tacos combo plate and a Tinga quesadilla.\n\nThe fact that they have tinga makes me very happy. It wasn't as \"tingaish\" as I would have liked it, but then again, no one has ever made me tinga like my Tia guty. \n\nThe bad:\n- teeny tiny parking. I came here at 4pm on a friday and was the only person there for a good ten minutes. I can't imagine finding a parking spot when there are more people around.\n\n- The tortillas weren't great. They're not bad, but they aren't anything special. A taco should have a good tortilla in case the meat sucks (not that it sucked here).\n- The rice and beans portion is small. WAY small. I get that a restaurant needs to make some profit, but these are tiny. \n\nThe good-\n\n- The quesadilla is huge. By huge, I mean I ate half of it and had to save some for later because of how filling the doughy tortilla is. This is not your average quesadilla. Not only do they use the right cheese (not your Americanized mozzarella and monterey jack or even, god forbid, chihuahua cheese), but the tortilla is flaky AND flavorful. That's a quality tortilla. This tortilla is nothing like the one used for the tacos, you can tell they make these themselves.\n\n-The variety of salsas is pretty damn good. They will have everything from the most unoffensively bland salsa for gueros to a chile de arbol salsa that could make my daddy sweat. \n\n- La horchata. Now this is what horchata should taste like. Other restaurants take note because people may come here solely for this. The fruit is a cute side trick, but the horchata really is good.\n\nI give it five stars because it reeks of unpretentiousness and we all know how much I loathe pretentiousness. The artwork is simple but quirkily Mexican, there is nothing fancy about the decor (which I like) and the cook looks like my Tio Memo (except he can cook whereas my Tio cannot). \n\nOverall, I hope they don't change a damn thing here. Let it become as popular as they can but please, please, don't change what you have! Finally, some authentic (and I hate using that word) tacos in Phoenix."

Their big advertisement is that they want to turn the tide of opinion on Mexican food/Tex Mex whatever from one of greasy, unhealthful junk to tasteful and thoughtfully-prepared fare- to the end of the latter, they did their due on me!\n\nThe woman and I had their take on quesadillas, which weren't the usual stupid flat flour tortilla cheese sandwiches with a pile o' salt and a not-pile of meat. In fact, these guys were made from homemade corn tortillas, deep fried (though not doused in grease) and filled well with your menu choice (In my case, al pastor; the wife got mahi-mahi). Folded over like a calzone and topped lightly with cojita sour cream, these guys are filled with flavor- flavor I've not experienced at any other Mexican joint in this city. The light crispiness of the tortilla really drives it home, and the quesadilla in all makes me think more of \"tamale grande\" than what you would classify as a quesadilla. (again, a boring flat cheese sandwich).\n\nThe price is kind of high; and while the portion is not *big* big as if you might get from a typical Mexican restaurant around here, let me tell you pals: It's well worth it.\n\nCan't wait to try some new things here, sometime.

Instantly, I could tell,  La Condesa Gourmet Taco Shop knows what they're doing in the kitchen, they care about quality, and are super fresh.  \n\nIf Mexican food can be judged by salsa, a good Mexican restaurant can also be judged by the frijoles.

My lunch buddy declared: \"This is as good as my favorite taco stand in Mexico!\" (She lived there for 6 years!) How's that for authentic?! The Horchata may be the best in town.

The Mayan taco was ....well...to use the term orgasmic would be both an understatement and a poor use of the word.  I took my parents there 4 days later and had a similar experience. My dream dinner there is to have many friends, many hours, many many tacos, and many beers or margaritas.  I am impressed with the food quality, but haven't had the beans or rice, I figure why?  They have tacos.  Also, impressive salsa bar with a pink radish salsa that I wanted to drink out of the bowl.  Yes, this is a hedonistic review, but I had a hedonistic time.  Go eat here.

The horchata is home made and the best I've ever had! They top it with cinnamon, pecans, strawberries, & cantaloupe. It sounds weird, but it was very good. They also use extremely fresh, crisp cabbage on their tacos. It was very impressive! My boyfriend had the pork shoulder \"quesa\" which is actually a fried quesadilla and that was also very very very good.

Unfortunately, it was before I yelped much, so I neglected to notice that they were closed Mondays:( Dejected, we drove down the street looking for someplace else to go. I can't remember if it was the Catrina that drove us in, but as soon as I saw the salsa bar, I knew I was in heaven. It was like actual food that I've actually eaten in Mexico (rather than assorted patterns of tortillas, rice, beans, and cheese). Now we take all visiting friends and family to this place. A visitor from LA said they were the best tacos he had ever eaten and I'm sure he wasn't lying. \n\nMany people have commented on the salsa bar. My favorites are the creamy ones (pecan, peanut, and cilantro) and most of all the sesame (to me, the spiciest one on the bar), and usually I try to sample some of each one - but taste is in the eye of the beholder. The important point is that you don't want to fill up on the chips, because you will be sad when your huge plate of food comes. So I'd like to share my strategies for maximizing the salsa enjoying experience without getting uncomfortably full.  I start by limiting myself to 5-6 chips which I break into smaller pieces for dipping. Once the food comes, I take the second tortilla from each of my veggie tacos (the tacos themselves already have just the perfect type and amount, so it's pointless to try and add more) and use it to scoop up the salsa. With only the one remaining tortilla, you do get some drippage, but you can add more salsa to any veggies and cheese that fall out and eat it with a spoon. Then for dessert, I pour the cilantro salsa on my rice. Mmmm, salsa. I would buy this stuff by the tub if they would let me. BTW, I asked - they just laughed. \n\nThe only draw back is that my poor husband tries to order a margarita every time we go, and they still don't have any. I hope someday they will take his advice and add it to the menu."

The Yelpers' raving reviews did not let us down.  When we got there it actually looked closed from the outside especially since the OPEN sign wasn't lit, but we took a chance and opened the door anyway to find that it was indeed open.  \n\nIt's a tiny little place with a Dia de los Muertos theme, so it was rich with color and culture.  There was only one server so it was a little slower than we'd like, but in her defense, she was pregnant. \n\nWe each had to order the horchata with pecans and melon because it sounded so good.  The cup it came in was HUMUNGOUS and thank goodness for that because it was awesomely delicious!  We also pigged out on the chips and variety of salsas at the salsa bar.  The salsas are seriously amazing and there were a lot to choose from and taste.  I especially loved the jicama salsa.  \n\nI ordered 2 carne asada tacos with rice and beans.  I was already so full from eating all those chips and horchata and usually it's hard for me to enjoy the taste of something after I'm super full, but the tacos were so good I finished them.  I only tasted a little bit of the rice, which was okay... probably my least favorite thing I ate there, but the beans were very good!  \n\nI was soooo full afterwards and I left with a smile on my face and a new favorite restaurant that I'll have to stop at whenever I'm in Phoenix, which isn't very often, sadly."

The pork shoulder was my favorite because of how well the marinations blended with the pork as well as the small hint of cinnamon... Fucked up good! Both tacos came with a plate of rice and beans.  As mentioned before the pork shoulder taco has cinnamon in it which my girlfriend is allergic to so she switched if for the Sonoran Carne Asada Taco. The carne asada was well done and you could taste the mesquite charcoal it was made on. The salsa bar is another reason why this restaurant is good, due to  how diverse it was. There were so many salsas that we couldn't test them all before the chips ran out; can't remember the names of all of them, but the peanut salsa was awesome."

I ordered One Baja Sur Dogfish Shark Taco as my Appetizer which was lightly battered and fried perfecty in obviously clean oil.    My Entree was the Oaxacan Black Mole Chicken Quesa.  The 2 Quesas were crispy, pastry like and filled with Mole Chicken.  Oaxaca cheese was sprinkled on top and was a nice compliment .

It's one of those hidden gems along 16th Street and I really wish I could give it five stars but I just can't. Here's my summary of the place:\n\nGood:\n-The tacos are delicious! My favorite is the Mayan Pibil taco. \n-The prices are pretty descent.\n-The salsa bar is AMAZING! I can't get enough of the pecan salsa. \n-The chips are free and they go fast with such great salsa selections.\n-The margaritas are tasty.\n\nBad:\n-The service is really bad. I'm not they type of customer to really care too much about service at a restaurant but it's pretty ridiculous here. I took my bf here the other day and it took about 8 minutes before anyone came to the table to greet us. I would say this was a fluke but, unfortunately, it's happened a few times now. Also, I have had two occasions when they forgot to bring out silverware/napkins. I've had a couple times when they've forgotten to bring out my margarita (they're really good here btw) and one time when they brought it out looking like it had been sitting under a heat lamp for 10 minues (all of the ice was melted). It's really sad how bad the services is because I absolutely LOVE the food/atmosphere.\n\nI guess the bottom line is that La Condesa makes some amazing gourmet tacos and salsa but they fall very short on the service. I'll be back but there are plenty of other places I can go and receive great food AND great service (i.e. Gallo Blanco at the Clarendon Hotel)."

It's pretty damned good ($3 delicious margaritas and $2 chicken tinga or carne asada tacos). \nTo start, there is the salsa bar. You get one basket of chips (any more than that you pay for, but my wife and I never eat more than 1 basket-full) and then there are about 16-20 different types of salsa and sauces to try. I've only been brave enough to try about 5 of them, and they've all been decent-really good. My favorite was their tomatillo, and their chipotle didn't really do it for me, but I don't usually enjoy the taste of chipotle peppers in general. Too smokey.\nThe first time I went I got 2 carne asada tacos and 1 chicken tinga taco. I was disappointed in the carne asada. The meat was dry and topped with dry shredded cabbage. It has a decent flavor, but I had to put salsa on it because it was too dry for me. The chicken tinga, on the other hand, was pretty fabulous. The chicken has a very flavorful sauce on it with good spice, and it's topped with pickled red onion. Fantastic. I also had a plate of rice and beans which were delicious as well. So, the second time I went in, I ordered only chicken tacos. No biggie.\nI highly recommend checking this place out. 5 tacos, 2 margaritas, and some rice and beans for $20. Brilliant."

When we got our stale store-bought, rubbery chips the salsa wasn't so appealing after all. We both ordered chicken burritos and were shocked when we got a basket with a tortilla filled with soggy chicken bits and bean soup. It wasn't possible to use a fork and knife in a basket so we tried to pick them up and the burritos spilled all over our hands. It was a mess! I asked the waitress to look at the menu again because we were not satisfied with the burritos. I hate to waste food but we could not force ourselves to eat them. She said we had to pay for the burritos and then she would give us \"one\" taco. She made us feel very uncomfortable as she waved her \"one\" finger in our faces so I told her we would pay for the food and then look at the menu again. She immediately brought me the check and waited over my shoulder for me to pay for it before she handed us the menus. Her angry attitude scared us, so we no longer wanted to look at the menu. We just wanted to leave and try out another restaurant. I would not recommend dining at this place. The quality of food was horrible and the service was even worse.

It isn't cheap by any means, but the salsa bar has so many choices (delicious each one) that more than makes up for the slightly higher cost.  And the choices don't just range from pico de gallo to hot to hotter.  Some are tart, some are creamy, some are smoky and hit the back of your throat, some are hot on the front end, etc.  Just go and taste it for yourself\n\nBecause I live close by, I prefer to take my tacos home because the space is very small and (because the food is so good) it can get quite cramped in no time.  (And when the unfortunate circumstance of someone bringing in a baby happens, there really isn't any way to pretend you aren't in hell no matter how much Yoda you think you can channel.)

Honestly.\n\nI always eat out when the general public isn't out in force, and I love going to La Condesa in the middle of the afternoon on weekdays.  Many good restaurants have the afternoon restaurant \"limbo\" period where they close until dinner, but it's great that this place doesn't.  \n\nEvery single thing I've tried there is so good I wind up benchmarking most other Mexican-style restaurants against La Condesa.  Starting with their tortilla chips and salsa, the chips are always super fresh, and their salsa bar is the best I've ever seen; all home/hand-made gourmet salsas, TWELVE in all, obviously all made fresh.  Each one by itself is incredibly great, while I have about 5 favorites I always focus on.  \n\nI got addicted to their mole sauce.  That's surprising for me because I'm not a big chocolate fan at all, and the first time I saw mole sauce, just the idea sickened me!  Plus the first time I tried it, the person who made it really didn't know what they were doing -- but that all did a serious about-face once I tried La Condesa's.  It's hard to not order their mole chicken, but if you want to try another truly interesting and great gourmet taco, burro, or bowl, try their Pork al Pastor, it'll blow you away too.  I recently tried it burro style, and with some fresh tortilla chips and a half dozen cups of various salsas, it was almost too much to eat -- I chose to just have ice water with the meal, and the whole tab came to about $9-bucks.  Even when you just want water they bring you a glass filled with ice and lime wedges, and a stopper-type liter sized bottle of ice cold water.  \n\nService is always fantastic too.  There isn't a whole lot of room in the place, maybe 15 tables and bar seating as well, which is why I also like going there when the crowds aren't around.  They're open for breakfast on Saturday's and Sunday's, I haven't been there during those times but I'd bet my bottom dollar they make a killer Huevos Rancheros!  \n\nThis is certainly a must visit restaurant if you haven't eaten there before -- I almost don't want to write such a great review because they do enough business as it is, and I don't want to ruin one of my favorite places to go!  I'm picky, but not unrealistically so -- it's not often I'll write a 1-star review, and the same goes for 5-stars.  This place is absolutely a solid FIVE STAR restaurant, hands down IMHO."

Looking at the chicken it appears like it's been sitting at room temperature all day. It's black, dry and old looking. They must think people are stupid and won't know the difference. It's harsh to say, but I could not finish a meal I purchased due to disgust."

They are traditional Mexico City style which are not in the flour tortilla as most places serve but are maid out flour ( I think they are from Mexico City because we were brought up eating them this way). They are deep fried which is worth trying just because of how deliciously amazing they are! There salsa bar is unique with lots of choices, but I do wish they had at least one spicy one. I think their service can improve, ( maybe our server was just having a bad day). But overall good place."

It is a true diamond in the rough part of phoenix.\nI ordered the carne asada burrito which is simply meat and beans. Anywhere else that would be boring and plain, but it was seasoned perfectly and full of flavor. A perfect vessel for the salsa bar from heaven. Every bite was different depending on what spicy concoction I chose.\nI also couldn't resist trying the maya conchita pibil taco, which was packed full of juicy shredded pork. So juicy in fact that I had to eat it quick because the corn tortillas were getting a bit soggy. Did I mind? Oh no. I just sopped up any juice left and sighed with pure contentment. They topped the taco with nothing else but pickled red onions that were delicious. Simple done right.  Can't wait to go back and get that horchata!"

Peanut and Pecan Salsa, WHAT!?! Both were tasty and new flavors. Mayan Cochinita Burro jumped off the menu. I had beverage ordering anxiety and caved to the Horchata. Best Horchata I've had. There are nuts, strawberries and other tasty floaters in it. The burro came, and it was lava-esque. I couldn't touch it for 20 mins. Luckily I had salsafest 2011 to keep me busy.

We ordered 5 different tacos a la carte - Cabo Shrimp Taco, Sonoran Carne Asada Taco, Aztec Tinga Taco, Mayan Cochinita Pibil Taco, La Condesa Shrimp taco. \nThe Cabo was tasty, but nothing to write home about, the carne asada was tasteless and overdone, the Aztec Tinga was not bad... but very one note and we were over it after the first bite. The Condesa Shrimp taco had  WAAAY too much garlic and the shrimp had zero flavor - I came across at least 10 full slices and I still have the taste of garlic in my mouth hours later. \nOverall it wasn't horrible - it just wasn't good - definately not 25 dollars worth -  this is not a place I would return to nor would I recommend it to anyone else\nIf you want good street tacos see my reviews."

I was freaking crazy about the Horchata though!  I am a salsa snob so it takes a lot to impress me.   Rule number one - it must cause burn or don't call it salsa.   The seven chiles was so good that there wasn't much left at the salsa bar.   What was left, I took!  Second best salsa was the salsa peanut!  It was creamy, hot, flavorful and the best salsa peanut I have ever had!  So happy that they serve real salsas. My only recommendation for them would be to improve on the chips.   The chips are a bit thin, but cover them with salsa and all will be alright. When in Phoenix-go to this place.   It's a bit small, but hang in there and grab a seat and set your tongue on fire then cool it down with the horchata!"

We had an hour since it was on my husbands lunch break, and decided on this place because I was craving some \"street tacos\", and the reviews/pictures looked awesome.... oh how I was wrong!!\n\nSeems easier to number all the issues we had!\n\n1. We walk in at 12:10 to a nearly empty restaurant, I first try to use the bathroom, and the light wasn't working... that should have been my first clue. \n2. We sit down and a few minutes later the place is packed, but for some reason everyone has been help except us!?! \n3. Finally someone comes to help, I ordered the horchata since it was mentioned so frequently in the reviews, my husband ordered a Sierra Mist (remember it came in a to-go cup with a lid)  The horchata was bizarra, and $4\n4. My 2 year old daughter grabs the free chips.. and I see MOLD on it, then realize the whole basket is full of moldy chips!! No wonder they are free!\n5. A different waiter finally shows up since the other waitress was busy taking care of the customers that came AFTER us... I ordered the Sonora Arrachera Taco, and told them about the MOLDY chips, he apologized and took the chips away.  The original waitress came back, apologized for the chips, and said she would comp the drinks, I returned the horchata, and got a Sierra Mist as well (also came in a to-go cup, there's a reason I am mentioning this)\n6. After 20 min and being there for 40 and food had not arrived I asked for it to-go. about 5 min later it came along with the bill that only included the food.\n\nBy this point I was annoyed but probably wouldn't have given it 1 star, so we leave with to-go cups in hand along with food. I dropped my husband off at work, then drove home. When I got home I ate 1 taco which was pretty good, the meat was flavorful and tender, I only wished I had some of that salsa to add to it. Then I got a text from my husband.....\n\n7. My husband asks \"is your Sierra Mist BROWN??? I  open the lid and sure enough it looks like dirty water!!!\n\nSeconds later the entire meal... is in the trash! VOMIT!   I gave this place more chances then I ever give a place.

We overordered as we wanted to try several things.\n\nThe salsa bar was fun.  It was nice to try a few different flavors.  My daughter who doesn't like spice really enjoyed the peanut salsa.  The tomatillo was exceptional as well.  \n\nI did not think the guacamole was well executed.   There were onions, tomatos, pineapple and cilantro but it was more pico-ish than guacamole-like.  And where was the avocado?  For $3.95 the portion was relatively small.  I would definitely pass on this in the future.    \n\nFor main courses, we had the mole chicken quesa and an assortment of tacos.  \n\nThe mole was exceptional and wasn't at all bitter.  The quesa itself was flaky, crisp and delicious.   If you are a mole fan, this is a must try.\n\nFor tacos, we had the baja shrimp, slow cooked pork and carne asada.  The shrimp was cooked perfectly and the breading light and didn't overwhelm the flavors.  I loved the pork which was moist, flavorful and satisfying.  The carne asada was very good though pretty typical street taco fare.   \n\nI will definitely dine here again.   The setting matched the food... casual, comfortable but not your typical mexican fare.  It's definitely a step above."

The shrimp went from being huge to about the size of a quarter. I was really disappointed. I'm hoping they just had a bad day and this will not be the norm."

Not exactly a jovial atmosphere for a wonderful spring day in March. I ordered the Carne Asada and a Cochinita Pibil to be washed down with an Horchata. I then proceeded to the Salsa bar which appeared to have an outstanding selection and I immediately started filling cups with the many varietals eagerly anticipating being able to dress up my tacos. Chips were then brought out to snack on while I waited for my food. I can only describe these as cold, flavorless, and typical of most chain restaurant chips. Not a good sign. My Taco's arrived shortly thereafter. Unfortunately these too were nothing to write home about. The tortillas were cold and appeared store bought. The carne asada was overcooked and lacked any form of flavor. I attempted to spice things up by adding salsas, but these too were flavorless. Very little spice and hardly any seasoning. The cochinita pibil was enjoyable, as it was juicy and tasted like a quality cut of pork, but wrapped inside of a cold store bought tortilla the experience was muted. \n\nI highly doubt I will be returning to this restaurant, and I honestly question those that have written such outstanding reviews. My opinion, no taco shop should bill itself as \"Gourmet\" if it does not make its own tortillas, has bland salsas, and cannot make a juicy and flavorful carne asada."

I had the Argentine Style which thats were my dad is from.. was not as great the meat needed seasoning and the chimichuri was bland , not to mention a little cheap on putting the sauce on , so i had to ask for more. But the one that got me was the shark tacos , now thats a taco ! Just wish the would recomend the sauces/ salsa to put on it that would help bring out more flavor. They have so many salsas I WANTED TO TRY ALL OF THEM !  Great place for a good lunch and awsome concept ! if you have'nt tried it , you must go once its a fine meal for $10. Happy hour prices seem to be reasonable also. I will be back again i must say and will ask more questions about the sauces."

Because my wife and I loved it so much on our first visit to La Condesa that we selfishly want to keep it a secret from others.\n\nThe food was really good and such a unique sampling of traditional Mexican food dishes, with a twist.  The mole was to die for and the shark tacos were amazing.  The rice is also so tasty and I am not usually a rice kind of guy.  I always forgo ordering the traditional side of rice & beans and initially I did the same on our visit.  But my wife ordered the rice with her meal and after seeing and tasting hers, I actually added that to my order even though we already had received our food.  Everyone has already mentioned the amazing salsa bar so I won't repeat the accolades other than to say what a journey of amazing and unique concoctions, coupled with a few of the standard salsas.  Have to recommend the cilantro salsa if you go and be prepared to order more chips if you want to take the salsa adventure and try them all!!!\n\nGets pretty packed during the standard rush hour periods but worth the wait and if you plan accordingly (noon or early dinner meal), you can avoid the surge.

        "review": "Of the countless Mexican restaurants in Phoenix, it's hard to find one with an authenticity to it that brings back memories of Mexico City. Fortunately, La Condesa, an excellent taco shop in an unlikely location, succeeds. The first time I went there, I wasn't quite sure what to expect, as I had been recommended numerous times by family members and friends. \n\nWhat I noticed immediately was the eclectic selection of homemade salsas. From smoky peanut sauce to deliciously sweet avocado salsa, Condesa has just about everything a chips & salsa lover could imagine. As for the chips themselves, they're actually warm and delicious even when not dipped in one of the many salsas offered. Condesa makes you believe that the chips are being made in the kitchen right before they bring them to your table, even if this isn't the case.\n\nThe restaurant's atmosphere perfectly matches the food, with excellent music playing at all times and fascinating art adorning every wall of the room. Based mostly off of classic Mexican art and architecture, La Condesa is beautiful to look at it if you decide to dine alone. Even if you are with friends or family, the many art pieces hung around the room will surely spark a conversation; they're all gorgeous and full of Mexican history.\n\nFor the main course, I had a Veggie Burrito with a side of rice and refried beans. Just about everything was absolutely delicious, and pouring a little bit of salsa on it made it even tastier. The beans weren't very full of flavor but were definitely enjoyable especially when eaten with the rice and burrito. \n\nSince my first visit, I've tried a variety of foods at Condesa but my favorite so far has to be the Shark Meat Burrito. Before trying it there I had never eaten shark meat before and always wondered what it could taste like. To my surprise, it was actually delicious and made for the perfect filling to an already delicious burrito filled with mushrooms, spinach, melted cheese, and garlic.\n\nTo drink I only had a pink lemonade, but the person I came with had Condesa's famous Horchata. While I'm used to the delicious and legendary Horchata from Mexico, I did enjoy the Horchata at Condesa, even if it wasn't as perfect as some of the more authentic renditions that I've tried over the past couple of years. \n\nThe fountain drinks are served in large cups, the kinds that you see in gas stations directly off the freeway, complete with a plastic lid and straw. Of course, the presentation wasn't anything fancy, but the cup is so large that needing a refill is unlikely, something I enjoyed (especially when the place is extremely busy, making it near impossible to get speedy service).\n\nThis brings me to my final, and only entirely negative, point. Where Condesa is lacking is in the service. While all the servers are very nice and accommodating, the food has a tendency to take a while to get to the table, especially if the restaurant is busy. With room for about 20 or 30 people at the very most, Condesa is a small restaurant, one that operates with a maximum wait staff of about three at all times. \n\nThe best advice I can give you is to take your trip to Condesa before the lunch rush, or before the dinner rush. The enjoyable experience of the food and atmosphere will be quickly deflated once the restaurant reaches 65% capacity or more. The tables are far too close together and eavesdropping on another group's dinner conversation is entirely unavoidable. It's best to not come with massive groups, as the restaurant prides itself on its intimacy. \n\nAnyone looking to try authentic Mexican food should come to Condesa immediately. While I'm one to enjoy places like Filiberto's almost any day of the week, the experience you'll have at Condesa is one that few other restaurants in Phoenix can offer. The prices aren't extremely high, and the food is worth every penny."

Margs were delicious and I cannot wait to do happy hour there - an afternoon of $3 margaritas and the amazing salsa bar with a great variety of salsas.

Everything we've eaten had a distinct flavor so you can really get a feel for lots of different tastes. Whatever kind of \"Mexican\" you are in the mood for; this place will deliver. Nothing here ever feels like it was rushed to be cooked faster.\n\nMy fianc\u00e9 and I have been here twice and the second time was even better than the first.\n\nThe first time we had 2 Cochinita pibil (pork) tacos, a Dogfish Shark taco and a Carne Asada taco. All of them were amazing with each having their own unique seasonings, complimentary accoutrement (pickled red onion for the pork, cabbage and creamy salsa for the shark etc.).\n\nThe second time we got a 'Dogfish Shark' taco, a chicken mole taco and a chicken burrito. The chicken mole was outstanding. My mouth is watering remembering it. It was a perfect earthy balance of the chili and the chocolate dancing on my tongue. The chicken burrito was also amazing in its simplicity. The refried beans are smoky and smooth in an indescribable way. The chicken was slow cooked and complimented the beans well. \n\nThe horchata was very good- and not gritty or powdery or too sweet like many places. My only complaint (because nothing's perfect right?) is I would have liked more ice. Yeah- that's all I could come up with.\n\nThe variety of salsas makes it fun. The first time we went they didn't have the strawberry salsa we had read so much about, so of course we had to come back! We got the strawberry salsa and there was also the peanut salsa which I preferred to the strawberry one. Again the variety of tastes in the salsa is fantastic. The flavor combinations are unique and widely varied from sweet, to savory to spicy.\n\nI work around the corner so will definitely be back for more!"

When I do, I tend to go an binges, scarfing down food from one or two of my favorite spots, and adding a new place that has been on my must-try list. This time, it was La Condesa. \n\nEverything about La Condesa took me by surprise, regardless of the high expectations I already had. I loved its interior--the small space, the rustic wood furniture, the artwork, everything. A big departure from the usual feel of cheap-mexican restaurants/taquerias, it felt homey, warm, inviting. I was expecting to just shoot a quick order to the girl at the counter, but instead got table service, and extremely friendly and attentive service to boot (sounds like it's usually an order-at-the-counter place, though). \n\nOn to the food: don't expect the usual suspects at the salsa bar--these salsas and toppings were phenomenal. I didn't ask, but I suspect they were all made in-house, and seemed incredibly fresh and were really a unique assortment. A great mellow, nutty peanut sauce, smokey chipotle salsa, creamy/salty cilantro, an awesome Mexican (or was it Mayan?) salsa (my favorite of what I tried)...my only regret was not sampling more.\n\nWhat I loved about the menu were the unique options that branched far beyond the usual suspects. I went with three tacos: tinga, mole, cochinita pibil. When they arrived, all of them looked beautiful, and were surprisingly and thankfully chocked-full of meat. I took one bite of the mole and...HO...LY.....SHIT. Ever go to a restaurant and casually take a bite of something without giving it too much thought, only to be immediately punched in the face by its deliciousness? I love it when this happens. It's one of those pure joys in life, and happens far too infrequently...but it happened here. I'm a sucker for any type of mole, but sometimes they fall a bit 'flat'. This one did not. It had a fantastic bite and complexity to it that really elevated the mole to one of the best I've had. The tinga and cochinita were both equally great. The meat in all three was insanely tender and flavorful from the great sauces they had simmered in.\n\nI paid the bill--$9.80--and realized that it was an awesome deal. Sure, you can find tacos in town for less than $3/ea, but they will not be like these. Not to mention, the portions were generous, I got free chips and a run at the salsa bar. \n\nI drove home feeling like I was teetering on the edge of purging...this was, after all, my second substantial meal in the course of 1 hour. But it was well worth it. Adding yet another spot to my list of places I have to hit when in the area. Already searching for an excuse."

That, with a large latte, was just over $12. \n\nThe pasty was pre-made and warmed in the oven so it came out fast and was so good. Very soft, perfectly baked pastry crust with a sprinkling of pepper and salt on top. The Scotch egg inside (hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage) was delicious. The sausage was perfect and not at all greasy and the egg was cooked just right.\nThe lemon bar was more of a type of lemon curd oat cake instead of just being the typical lemon-y gel stuff over graham cracker crust and was really good. I like that it was more hearty than your average lemon tart. The shortbread was a little harder than I like but has nutmeg and cinnamon in it and was great when I dipped it in a hot coffee I made myself later.\nThe latte was great too. It wasn't anything special but wasn't too milky and the coffee wasn't bitter which is all too common in less-commercial coffee places. Just right.\n\nYou can see right into the chocolate-making area and there were a bunch of different types including these huge high heels made of chocolate. Really cool!

Thanks to Yelp - I found this place just looking for Espresso and  was pointed in Rayner's direction."

The strip mall in which it's located is nondescript so pay attention, but if you are near ASU West or Thunderbird, make a pit stop! The latte was sufficient - not the best press I've had but definitely not the worst - but the savory and sweet treats are what sold me. The service was sweet, helpful, and graciously warm! The feeling was just happy and homey. The pastries rival what I tasted in Europe, and my savory biscuit breakfast sandwich tempted me to order a second (which would have triply killed my diet). I was delighted to see they sell truly Briton fares, and I not only have some PT's tips, I also have a new box of Builder's tea to cut my teeth on Monday through Friday to save myself from sad corporate coffee. Builder's is not a pansy tea, no way, this is the stuff of the makings of that enviable strong, upper lip of the quintessential Brit that we Americans somehow lost in our independence. As far as tea goes God Save the Queen, and as far as pastry and coffee goes, long live Rayner's!"

The place is fairly hidden, in a non-descript  strip mall on the east side of  51st Ave just north of Thunderbird but worth the effort. Their coffee is exceptional but my current fav is an iced Jujube fruit and black tea. I'm addicted. We're eating our way through their pastries; the croissants remind me of the ones I enjoyed in France. And their homemade chocolate-dipped biscotti  and Meringues (both Pistachio and Strawberry) are heavenly. There is a very particular German woman at work who gave very high marks to their Pear Financier Tarts (us too). And don't ignore their sandwiches and salads. They have a build-your-own sandwich for $5.25 that puts to shame the same sandwich with much lower quality ingredient at Sprouts for$ 2.99. And where else can you get handmade chocolate stilettos (for real)! We are delighted to finally have this level of quality in the bakery coffee and chocolate department on our side of town."

I despise everything about you, Miracle Mile.\n\nUnless someone had cued me into the fact, I never would have guessed that you were trying so hard to duplicate NY deli-style fare. Why so? Because every NY staple I've tried from your fetid excuse for a deli has sucked so effing hard it just about pulls grey matter out through my ears. \n\nStale and mealy defrosted cheesecake that was as unappetizing to look at as to consume. Matzo ball soup so bland I had to keep looking down to assure myself I was indeed consuming something other than hot air. Wilted salads guaranteed to deflate my hopes upon first bite. Vegetable soup that was so flavorless as to be nearly nonexistent. Are you trying that hard to fade into the background, you wallflower? It's no wonder the median age of a patron in your restaurant is pushing 80. The near total annihilation of my taste buds is the only way I would ever step foot through your doors again.\n\nAnd then there's your pathetic excuse for a sandwich, Mile. Pastrami and corned beef sandwiches piled (not so) high with bland, fatty meat that's been slopped with reckless abandon atop your choice of bread, guaranteed to disintegrate in five seconds flat. All topped off with a slice of sweaty Swiss cheese that adds zero flavor and flops listlessly atop a piteous excuse for a sandwich. If it weren't for the spicy mustard at each table, I'd hardly have tasted anything at all! Bravo! You surely deserve an award for the most poorly constructed sandwich in all of Phoenix! \n\nAlthough I guess that dubious honor should clearly be bestowed upon your brusque, monosyllabic cafeteria line workers. \"Next? Bread?\" Unappetizing slop of meat, slid down the line to the next guy. \"Fries?\" Heap of fried garbage, liberally applied, slid down the line. That is, unless you're asking for something outside of the crap-sandwich-and-fries box. At that point your request will be wordlessly acquiesced to with a scowl and a slop. \"Drink?\" No! Please! NO! Just get me out of this slovenly pit of cafeteria hell. What do you want, I'll pay anything! Anything!\n\nWait a tic. That's your whole ploy all along, isn't it Miracle Mile? Brainwash the masses with mediocre food and overcharge for everything to make it seem like it's a privilege to be dining upon such slop.\n\nWell I'm on to you. I've given you plenty of chances, Mile. Your Reuben was the only sandwich that didn't make me want to violently upend tacky cafeteria tables on the way to my car. \n\nWishing you the bland, inoffensive dreams of an automaton,\nErica"

This was Hubby's suggestion, mind you, and he was pleased they had several vegetarian options. After a lunch of Peter Piper, however, even his lame veggie sandwich was pretty good to him. We'll see if I have to rush him to the ER later, since MM served sprouts when no one else is right now due to a contamination issue. He got his sandwich with a supposed potato knish. This was supposed to be creamy mashed potatoes with sour cream and seasonings in a pastry crust. What he got was an overly peppered dried out, square of potato chunks in an unnatural color wrapped in an anemic crust that had zero taste, crunch, or flake to it. It had that speckled look that old pastry gets. If this is what a knish is supposed to be, then they nailed it.\n\nI got the chicken and noodles with a side of mashed potatoes. It came with two inexplicable slices of untoasted bread. What is this? 1950? At least it wasn't Wonder Bread. It was wheat. I had asked for sour dough, when one guy told me there were no caraway seeds in the rye they served me initially. There were. The manager \"saved\" me by correcting his employee about the caraway, only to be given the third degree by the ghetto tart working the register. \"Why don't you like caraway?\" she asked. I tried not to stare at her ridiculously over-plucked eyebrows and garish make-up as I replied, \"I really don't like the taste.\" When she asked me \"Why?\" a second time, you'll be happy to know that I refrained from informing her that the gang-bangers she was obviously trying to attract would not likely be frequenting  this establishment. Anyway, the chicken and noodles dish was complete mush and the \"sauce\" was totally canned, and topped with a lovely hunk of congealed cheese. It was also not to temp. The mashed potatoes were 75% instant with some red skins thrown in for that \"real\" texture. Foul, foul, foul. \n\nHence, the grilled cheese."

The sandwiches are fine but not a 5 star deli. They have a nice selection of foods and sandwich options. The desserts look good but I have not tasted any in a long time so not sure how yummy they are. I did not see any Black or White cookies nor Cannolli tonight but I think they have NY style Cheesecake now and again. \n\nFor my dinner tonight I had the Chicken Salad on an onion roll. I have had that a few times in the past and it has always been pretty good. It is not the best I have had but pretty good. I will leave it at that. They also have Knishes, which are hard to find in Phoenix. \n\nThe problem is this place is expensive for Phx standards. I just got back from NY and I paid more for three items here than I did for 6 items there. Hmmmmmmmmm??Of course the food is not nearly as good as the NY food. \n\nI guess this is probably one of the better delis in town if you can not make it to Cassellas in Scottsdale or NY Hero in Downtown Phoenix."

For instance the Straw! juicy Pastrami piled high with melted Swiss cheese and hot sauerkraut on rye bread delish. Ok I must admit I was a Pastrami virgin before the mile. So I have nothing to base the deliciousness of this pastrami against. All I can tell you is it tastes great to me. \n\nNow I am not a virgin when it comes to there Macaroni salad and that salad came to party! It's really good! \n\nThe deserts are great to I love the pecan pie! I cannot even call it pecan pie it is PEEECAN Pie, not to sweet just right scoop of vanilla ice cream sets this off! The cheesecake is yummy and the carrot cake well it is some of the best I have tasted in awhile. \n\nAlso this little known tid bit, they serve farmer brothers coffee! Which I find to be the best of the pre-ground coffee's out there. I prefer farmer brothers over Starbucks any day. \n\nCheck out the mile and try the pastrami. \n\nPS I gotta knish once, yea once.

        "review": "Miracle Mile is a classic of Phoenix.  I remember as a child going to Chris-Town Mall with my parents and begging them to get me a hot-dog from MM, it was that good.  I've been visiting this deli in one location or another all of my life - of course, Chirs-town is now gone and MM left long before it's demise, but back in the day, there was a MM in every big mall.  Nowadays, the one for me is at the Colonnade mall.  This location is a big, open dining room, sort of cafeteria style seating and cafeteria style ordering.  Parking outside is a breeze.  You go in, and line up in one of two super-efficient lines, usually there is only one, but when it's busy they will open a second.  Don't worry, if there is only one line, these guys have been doing it for a long time, they move fast.  Shortly, you end up in front of the meat guy, tell him which sandwich you want, what kinda bread you want it on and so fast his hand will blur, he slices the bread, puts some delicious pastrami, brisket, Corned Beef or whatever on it, plates it and slides it down to the fries guy.\n\n  Sandwiches are ordered from the menu board on the wall above.  I'm always torn - Brisket, BBQ pastrami, New Yorker or a Straw - they are all so good it's that difficult to decide.  I've never really tried any of their hot specials, although they always have something like a baked fish on Fridays, some days enchiladas, BBQ chicken, Cabbage Rolls and of course, like any good Jewish Deli, Matzo Balls - These dishes are all very tempting to me, but I cannot break away from the sandwiches.  They also do egg salad, hot dogs, hamburgers and other cold sandwiches and salads.  \n\nWhen the Fries guy gets the plate, you tell him if you want a pickle spear, Fries or something else.  Something else like cottage cheese, cole slaw, jello, potato latkes, etc, etc - see, it's just like a cafeteria, only with really good choices.  The fries guy piles on your fries, slaps the plate on a tray and it moves to the dessert section.  So tempting, cakes, pies, puddings, pastries, all fresh-made.  I'm not a big sugar eater, but the desserts could even tempt me.  I generally pass.  Finally, the drink order, the usual sodas from the fountain, some bottled sodas, even beer if you want.  My Drink of Choice, iced tea and in the double-digit number of years I've been enjoying MM, I have never, underline, bold, NEVER had a bad iced tea.  \n\nFinally, you gotta pay for all this, find a table and begin your noshing.  The dining room can be quite noisy, it's large, generally full at lunch time and if you need some quiet and it's a nice day, they have some tables on the walk outside.  Sometimes I will go to these tables to enjoy my brisket quietly, sometimes the hustle and bustle and people-watching keeps me in the dining room, no matter what, it's always a slice of heaven for me."

I know this turns many people off, but if you give the place a chance, I don't think you will be disappointed.  As I said earlier, the food is quite good.  My favorite is \"The Straw\".  It contains mounds of hot pastrami, melted Swiss, and sauerkraut.  You have your choice of bread and I always choose the onion roll.  If you like corned beef, try \"The New Yorker\".  It's similar to \"The Straw\" but with corned beef and coleslaw.  All sandwiches include fries and a pickle spear.  You can add everything from macaroni and cheese to steamed veggies on the side.  A typical lunch will set you back $10-$11, but most people can make 2 meals out of the sandwich.  File this one under my \"Best Lunchtime Eats!\""

After I had agreed to be the one to pick it up, they picked Miracle Mile, and I couldn't back out at this point...so I decided to just go with it.\n\nI got the Miracle Mile Special, which was a cup of soup and half of a sandwich and a side dish.  I got the Navy Bean soup, pastrami with coleslaw on rye bread and some potato salad.  I generally love Navy Bean soup....but this was so bland and brothy, it was not anything like the Navy Bean soup I have had in the past.  There was also no ham in it....boo!

Who performs that act of sacrilege? At any rate, their fries make for a nice side to their sandwiches, but I actually prefer their potato pancakes. They also have a very good matzo ball soup (although my mom's recipe is by far the best), but I don't recall them serving it on a daily basis. Another excellent choice is their split pea soup. The nice thing about Miracle Mile is that they serve a specific menu of dinner entrees for each day of the week. Try their hot turkey dinner, which is simply the best. This is a nice, casual dining place to enjoy good food, and, located on Camelback Road, it makes for easy access to the Biltmore Fashion Park or downtown Scottsdale."

Having known the family of this establishment my whole life, I can personally attest to their devotion to their food, the customers and the atmosphere.  The Garcia family first hit a home run with their original deli location at Christown Mall.  When they moved out of Christown they opened up a pair of locations with huge fanfare both at the Colonade and at Arrowhead Mall.  To be honest, I didn't think the Colonade would do all that well as they were invisible from Camelback Road.  Little did I know the following this place had.  Everytime I've gone the place has been jumping.  And rightfully so.\n\nWhen you walk in you immediately notice the fun color scheme as well as how clean it looks.  The aroma from the hot line is as alluring as you'd expect.  No waiters or reservations here.  Just hop in line and order your dish from the cooks as they make it right in front of you.\n\nMy tried and true favorite is the brisket sandwich on kaiser bread with a side of fruit and a slice of one of their fresh pies to boot.  Sometimes I'll grab some pastrami or corn beef as an alternative.  They've also got burgers and kosher hot dogs if you prefer.  Other sides include chili, fries, mac and cheese, or one of a number of soups.  The food is delicious but simple.  And whatever you order, you'll feel like you're in a New York style deli (without the NY attitude of course).\n\nSo why only 4 stars instead of 5?  Well for one, this hip deli near the Biltmore area isn't cheap.  True, you get what you pay for, but I couldn't afford to eat here everyday.  A good meal here usually runs around $15 -$20 so just be aware of that.  Also, this place is wicked busy, especially during dinner.  Usually you can find a seat, but it can get pretty noisy in there.  Don't let this scare you away though.  Especially if you live in the central Phoenix area.  Alot of the folks who eat here are people from the neighborhood so its highly possible you'll run into someone you know.  If you're on the west side, their location at Arrowhead Mall won't disappoint either.  \n\nLet's give props to the folks at Miracle Mile.  This small family operation has grown by leaps and bounds over the years, but you'd never know it talking to the owners.  The same humble attention to good food, a good atmosphere, and a neighborhood following still holds strong after all these years.  Success clearly hasn't changed this family recipe."

It was alright. the ham was thin sliced and tasty, the bun however was not so good and the lettuce not so crisp. My friend had a chef salad and well it did not look very fresh either, the cheese was sort of melting back together though it had cute little cut out shapes. The lettuce not so crisp once again. The child with us seemed to enjoy the kid serving of Mac and cheese and was able to finish it. So the portion size was good for a 6 yo. \nI did notice that a lot of people seemed to not eat all or any of the bread or bun their meal was on so though I'm picky, it appears to be a fair assessment that there is an issue with all the bread other than the rye. \nOh and the fact that a kids meal comes with soda is an issue, you have to pay more to give your kid a milk! That astonished me. So much for healthy America. Kid's meal comes with a cookie, French fries (yes with mac & cheese) and pop. I feel the children getting fatter reading the menu. So this Saturday lunch snatched $25 from us for a Chef salad from like two days ago, a ham sandwich on 2 day old bread and a fatten up you child kid's meal with milk and one adult small soda.

        "review": "Three Non-Inflated Truths About Miracle Mile:\n\nFirst: I don't get what all hype is about this place? This really isn't that much of a deli. It's more of a Luby's meets Subway. I'm not using that as a put down, it's just the best way I can think of how to describe this place.\n\nSecond: The food isn't great, it's just pretty good. I'd been hearing people rave about this place and how it was a NY style deli. Chompie's is more NY than this place and the food is generally tastier there. I ordered a turkey sandwich on french bread with Swiss and cranberry sauce... It was okay and filled me up but it wasn't anything particularly memorable.\n\nThird: Miracle Mile dishes out pretty solid portions. It's not too much and it's not too little. To be honest, it's probably a little more toward too much... but in a good way.\n\nGo to Miracle Mile for a decent meal, just don't expect the Second Coming."

It is a total guilty pleasure.   They've been in the Valley since 1949 and when I was a kid we used to go to the Christown location every weekend. My grandma used to always order the polish sausage  and my mom loved the hot brisket sandwich.  Even though it's not an authentic Jewish deli, it's still really good food. Other things I love here are the New Yorker sandwich and the vegetable soup.  Lots of yummy food at a good price."

I will always love you.\n\nI grew up in Phoenix during the 70s and 80s, offspring of parents who had grown up on the East Coast and knew what a real deli was supposed to taste like and smell like, and at that point in Phoenix history MM was the only game in town for that kind of experience. Probably still is. \n\nAnyway, we ate at the old Park Central location hundreds (okay, maybe just dozens and dozens) of times, sampling everything on the menu -- the pastrami is still my favorite, though. I can even remember when they expanded and built out that back patio with the koi pond, which quickly became my favorite place to sit when I went there with my mom. The Chris-Town location was okay, too, but it didn't have the koi pond so it wasn't as interesting to me.\n\nAnd the guys who worked behind the counter, what a bunch of old pros. If you went there during lunch rush, you had better know what you wanted when you reached the counter (and since you'd probably been staring at the menu for five minutes you had no excuse not to) or you'd get sent to the back of the line!\n\nI was sad to hear that Park Central location was gone, a little piece of my childhood being closed off. But this location at the Colonnade, it's not bad and the pastrami is every bit as delicious as I remember from years past. I can't wait until the next time I'm in Phoenix to visit my mom so we can go there again!"

        "review": "Well, being pretty new to Yelp, I have started jotting down places I wanted to check out. Of course, knowing their hours definitely helps. After planning on a stop at Blue Fin (which isn't open on the weekends), I ended up at Miracle Mile at Camelback Colonnade following a quick stop at Trader Joe's. I ended up being pleasantly surprised with the result, though the price was a little higher than I had hoped.\n\nWalking in, the decor is pretty laid back; clean and open, with a dessert station right by the door (never a bad idea) and an easy path to the counter. My first time there, so I had to do the \"What do I want?\" walk through the line. Luckily, it was slow, so I was able to pick out the Combo sandwich (pastrami and corned beef). Watching them make the sandwich, you could see how thin cut the meat was, and the marble rye looked fresh (other choices include sourdough, rye, and a few types of buns). There were a multitude of options for sides (french fries, a few pasta salads, etc), but I ended up paying the extra $1 for mac&cheese. From there, it was a quick walk to the register to pay $11 for my meal, along with grabbing some free horseradish.\n\nI took the food home, and it was worth the wait. The sandwich, which seemed a little small when the cook made it, suddenly grew to a thick mass of beef. I even had to pick off a few slices that were falling out before taking a bite. Gotta say, it was excellent. The pastrami and corned beef were a perfect match, and there was just enough fat to give it that extra burst of flavor. They give you regular mustard with the sandwich, but I preferred my own spicy mustard, with the occasional addition of horseradish (which had a good bite). The bread was perfect, and the crust broke away with every bite. Finally, the mac&cheese was a great addition. The flavor could have been stronger, but it was very cheesy and the pasta was firm without being overcooked.\n\nOverall,  this was a pretty good find. As others noted, the price is a little steep for a deli, but you will certainly get a full stomach for around $10, so I can't complain too much. It may not be a usual stop, but it was a good find."

It is consistently some of the tastiest food I've had, every time I come here.\n\nMy favorite is the stuffed cabbage.  It reminds of the way my Mom used to make it.  So delicious.  So wonderful.  So much like homemade food, but I mean that in a good way.  My Mom was the best cook I've ever known.  Her food was always something worth eating.\n\nAnyways, the stuffed cabbage has this delightful sweet and sour sauce with tomatoes and raisins, and is so good by itself, but then add in the cabbage and the ground beef and rice, and it is quite a meal by itself.  You also get your choice of some fresh veggies or a potato dish to have along side the stuffed cabbage.  I also will get a potato pancake just to splurge a bit.  \n\nAnd don't forget to pick up one of the little horse raddish cups by the cash register.  It is freshly ground that morning and it is powerful!  And very good with stuffed cabbage.\n\nThere are also lots of tables to sit at, so if you don't feel like sitting too close to anyone else, just come early and choose your own table accordingly.  You carry your tray of food to your own table by yourself, unless you ask them to help you with it.  I like that.  It's a little bit like a buffet in that respect."

Cafeteria style, so know what you want by the time you get to the counter.  It's a great place to go on Sunday morning and read the paper while you enjoy a carved sandwhich.  Of course, there is nothing heathy about any of this food, but it's solidly tasty and satisfying.  Slightly pricey (hot dog special is a good economic choice), but the atmosphere is relaxing, always clean, consistent quality, and they have free self-service water, so you don't have to bother with getting back into line if you're still thirsty.  \n\nWhat makes it unique is its authenticity and distinction from chain and fastfood stores.  It's not particularly interesting food, just good to satisfy your deli cravings.  Plus, I believe it's locally owned with gives it actual personality.\n\nCome on Sunday and then walk down to PetCo.

The bacon was wonderfully crispy, the turkey was thin and absolutely delicious, and the pickle (spear on the side) was cold, crispy and yummy. I got applesauce on the side instead of fries...I only took a couple bites (waaaay too full), but it's very good and it's chunky; not quite so pureed as traditional applesauce. I don't know if they have it made for them or if it's some applesauce you can buy that I wasn't aware of, but I like it.

I wasn't thrilled with any of their HH drink specials, so I just ordered one of their specialty martini's with Prosseco and some other yummy goodness! I loved my martini, which is good because I realized they were 11 bucks a pop when I got the bill!  Hottie ordered a Stella on tap, but was served a bud light, they served him another... same thing. I am convinced they had the kegs switched up.   For appetizers we ordered fried pickles (Hottie's choice) and grilled artichoke.  The pickles were dipped in a thick batter similar to that of fish and chips- Ick!  The artichoke was okay, but covered in oil... I mean my hands were dripping.   For dinner Hottie ordered some \"Jumbo Prawn\" and Andouille Sausage skewer with a side of baked beans.  His \"Prawns\" were not jumbo and they were obviously shrimp. His food was covered in oil too... I grill a lot at home and you don't need very much oil, that's what's great about grilling!  For dinner, I ordered three sides, truffle and parmesan mashed potatoes, mac n cheese and grilled asparagus.  The asparagus was excellent, the mac n cheese was okay, nothing special, and the potatoes were bland and dry... big disappointment.

It was really not very good. The chips were alright, but oily, and the dip was bland. So I ordered the bbq short rib slider with a side of garlic mash and the BF ordered the burger. We waited a long while for the entrees to arrive and our water cups were also left empty many times. The entrees were good. I got a lot of short rib for fairly inexpensive. The flavor was good, but it was very rich. The mashed potatoes were good, but not super flavorful and they came in a cute mini skillet thing, but the skillet wasn't hot....so neither were the potatoes. The BF said his burger was ok... not awesome but ok. He had the onion fries (regular fries with seasoning)....these were good at first, the ketchup was really good (spicy), but the fries got a bit monotonous after the first few. We had the chocolate bread pudding for dessert. It was huge! I liked that they separated the ice cream from the pudding. I thought the bread pudding was very good except there were parts that were really dry and other parts that were fine. I don't think any part of a bread pudding should be dry. It was good but didn't live up to the hype, which is kind of how i feel about this restaurant overall. I was really excited to try it, as it is a project from the same people as the mission (which is sooo goood in both service and food), but I was a bit disappointed (with both service and food). Maybe it just needs more time."

Kinda southwest campfire meets contemporary.\n\nWe had a couple of drinks and checked out the menu.  I like a place instantly that has Kiltlifter on tap!  There were a lot of items on the menu that looked great and I want to try on my next visit.\n\nCool atmosphere, interesting menu items and friendly service.  It all looks good for these guys!"

Can't say there was anything to brag about at all. Pickles were battered spears, and not that bad, eggs were half as good as mom's, meatballs... I'm half Italian and the meat part was decent (definitely home made) but the sauce was closer to bbq than marinara and the jalapeno poppers were hotter than 5 star thai food. I love heat, but these made me suck on a napkin. Chef needs to taste before serving. The kicker... $9 for a shot of Bushmill's to go with our beers. Kinda steep. BUT, again, it's fun, friendly, amazing decor... maybe with some refinements they can make this a great place to hang."

        "review": "I first went to Bonfire Grill and Bar on 8/12 with a friend and we ordered two apps each, they were: skewered grilled cheese sandwich, the skewered handmade pork meatballs, the tenderbelly st. louis pork ribs and the salt and pepper fried pork belly biscuits. Our visit to the restaurant was at around 9:30p and were surprised to see only a few diners. Let me say that the food served at Bonfire Grill is pretty good. Of course, the pork ribs could have a less sweeter sauce and something with a little more kick but overall every small plate we ordered was yum. I also got myself the Sangria which was refreshing. My two star review is simply because of bad service. \n\nFrom the start, getting the attention of our server proved to be a task, water refills had to be asked for as well as giving the bartender/server/available person around a dirty look hoping to get their attention just for more water. I really feel that bad or lackluster service regardless of how good the food can ruin the dining experience. Granted on our first visit there, the food and drink made up for the lack of service that I made the decision when I left that I would come back. FASTFORWARD to 8/19. I mentioned Bonfire to two friends and was able to get them to come out for dinner and try out Bonfire. I reassured them that it was a good place to go to, and on the drive to Bonfire I started salivating over the yummy salt and pepper fried pork belly biscuits. \n\nThis time around again on a friday night, the Bonfire was happening. A band was playing and upon walking in, the restaurant was busy and almost full. We were given a choice to sit at either a table or booth, and we chose the booth. My second dining experience at Bonfire and my friends first was doomed from the moment we chose the booth to sit at. Upon closer look, the table was not clean, and we had to wait for it to be cleaned after having to ask someone to do that. Upon seating, menus were handed to us, and the service ENDED there. We were seated at 9:45p and no waters were served or was a drink order even taken from the time we sat down, at 10:05p, with no server in sight to even check on us or even assist us, my friends and I were ANNOYED. I even decided I was gonna call the resto from the booth to inform them that the corner booth we were at was being IGNORED by their staff. 20 minutes of no acknowledgement or service whatsoever is unacceptable. After waiting 20 minutes, failing to get the attention of a server or any server whatsoever, we decided to leave. I am dismayed that a restaurant in old town that has promise suffers from a severe lack of customer service. Regardless of how busy your resto might be, I would hope your staff are trained to realize which table might need assistance and whatnot, Bonfire showed a lack of care, and has marred any positives I may have held in regard towards this resto. Bad customer service = a bad dining experience and hence my two stars."

Good grilled cheese sandwich with some bacon and arugula that makes it a bit different from the usual. They have a good sangria that's like juice. I was looking forward to trying out different stuff when I went again, but I ran into the same problem, but magnified that I ran into last time I went, and that was poor service. \n\nI and a group of my friends went back, wanting them to experience the food as well. And we went on a Friday night around 9:30 and, as expected, it was busy. Now, the last time I went, it was another Friday night around 8 and their place was slow, like the only tables in were ours, a table of 6 on a high top, and a few other patrons at the bar. Service was slow then too. I chalked it up to the fact that our server was pulling double duty and playing bartender. \n\nBut tonight was different. It was busy. It was like 15-20 minutes before happy hour, the band was going and the place was packed, like the usual restaurants in the area on a Friday night. And tonight, we were seated fairly quickly. Well, more like we were escorted to our table and then stood around, waiting for it to be bussed, but we were fine with that. We were able to sit down and peruse the menu. We were trying to make up our mind, when the person we thought was the server came over. It turned out that the guy wasn't our server, just a guy dropping off the silverware and plates. He apologized and corrected us in our error and assured us that our server would come by shortly. \n\nWell that didn't happen. People came by, and they kept on going by. At one time, one my friends attempted to call the restaurant in order to get someone to get to the table, but no one answered. Maybe the band was too loud or maybe they just don't answer their phones. It was then, that was had a glimmer of hope - a server heading in our direction. And what did this server do? Keep on passing us by. Well, needless to say, that was the end of that visit. We had had enough. We don't think we're gonna be back, at least not for a long while."

The bacon, bread and cheese were good but they put \"roasted tomatos\" on it as well and they were terrible. I did try the meatballs which were okay.

The light green avocado mayo tasted almost the same as regular mayo . My sliders also had a spec of artichoke and a chunk of very ripe tomato . I received onion fries that tasted sort of like BBQ seasoning mixed with seafood seasoning . I do have to say the ketchup was a hum ding er above average ketchup that should be named TWANG sort of an apple taste and this long lasting twang . The buns were heavy bread.\n\nWe also had the Chipotle Meatball sliders with Bonfire chips . My companion thought the meatballs were dry . These sandwiches didn't have enough sauce to get any taste of it and the shaved Parmesan was cooked into a sauce that were topped on the meatballs (we were expecting shaved parmesan since that is on the menu) . The Bonfire Chips were good and they came with a real cheese sauce .\n\nBoth lunches were good but over all rates average. I know so much work went into these dishes and feel bad only giving 3 stars but I really wanted the chicken to be better.

        "review": "At last, a restaurant worth blogging about!! It's been a long dry spell filled with mediocre meals, and a few real losers. In fact, my despair was so great it drove me to diet. We'd go out occasionally, but it was always easy to order a salad (my fat free dressing traveled with me) and not feel deprived. So it was with low expectations that we went to Bonfire Grill and Bar.\n\nThis five month old newbie is in Old Town Scottsdale, occupying the building that had housed Furio. That it is close to The Mission (see my 7/1/10 blog \"Kiss My Grits) is no coincidence. Matt Carter, executive chef and proprietor of both The Mission and\nZinc Bistro created the menu, and his former sous chef Eric Guerin is now Bonfire's executive chef. Carter mentored the manager of Bonfire, Jimmy Swann, a firefighter and newcomer to the restaurant business. It's rare to find a team so eager to please their customers.\n\nBonfire serves elevated American comfort food. Many of the selections are cooked over a pecan wood fire, and this divine smell greets you in the parking lot. There were so many temptations on the menu, I knew my diet dressing would remain hidden in my pocketbook. We started by sharing a grilled artichoke ($8) filled with sun dried tomatoes, and served with a delicious garlic aioli. It was quite large, perfectly tender, and fed three of us. \n\nIt wasn't easy to select our entrees. One of everything would have been nice. But eventually I ordered the BBQ Short Rib Skewer sandwich ($9) served on MJ bread with beer braised onions, Tillamook cheese and a chipotle BBQ sauce. It came with fries, lightly dusted with onion powder and a homemade chipotle ketchup. The chipotle taste was evident, but the heat level was happily low. The chunks of short rib were tender and moist even though all the fat had miraculously disappeared. Ken had short ribs too, but his entree came from the brunch menu - Short Rib Hash With Buttermilk Biscuits ($10).\nThe chef obligingly put the potatoes on the side in a cute little iron pot. The biscuits were both chewy and fluffy. Ernest decided on the Skewered Grilled Cheese Sandwich ($7) With Roasted Tomato, Bacon and Arugula. He seemed very pleased. Anna's Pecan Grilled Harris Ranch Burger ($9) looked good, but her Honey Mustard Coleslaw was the real hit. It was lightly dressed, yet full of flavor. Given the size and quality of these dishes, the price was truly a bargain. The only nit I might pick here (I had to find one so you wouldn't think I'd lost my edge) is the over-use of the skewer concept.\n\nSince I'd already blown my diet, why pass up desert? A Cast Iron Toasted Marshmallow Smores dish with Shaved Chocolate, Graham Cracker Cookies (homemade, not the flat board-like kind), and Malted Vanilla Ice Cream ($6) went with the Bonfire concept, but Jimmy urged us to try the Chocolate Bread Pudding with Banana Ice Cream ($6). Good choice! A huge portion of warm, gooey chocolate with hints of banana and caramel paired perfectly with the ice cream. Eventually I gave my spoon to Ken and told him not to give it back no matter how much I begged.\n\nThe ambiance is pleasant. Lots of dark wood, with an impressive wooden collage on the wall behind the bar, commissioned from a local artist. I think it would be nice if more art work took the place of some of the innumerable TV sets lining the walls. But at least their sound was muted, and enjoyable music was being played at a reasonable noise level (live music Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights). There's a communal table, booths, high and low top tables, and very comfortable upholstered chairs. A good thing if you can't bring yourself to leave between lunch and dinner service."

When we walked in we were hit with the overwhelming odor of FISH. My god, it was terrible (and only salmon was on the menu, that I recall). Thankfully, we stuck around because the rest of the night looked up.\n\nThey have happy hour every day until close. That meant a couple bucks off beer, half price well drinks, etc., but glasses of wine were full priced (and the by the glass list was decent!) and so was the food.\n\nMy friend and I picked three apps to share. She had the grilled cheese. While I didn't try it, she said it was great and it was beautifully plated (everything was--presentation is great here). I did have a couple of her house-made BBQ chips, which were outstanding.\n\nWe shared an order of 4 pork belly sliders. They were incredible. From the soft but toasted bread on the bottom to the interesting toppings... it was great. I had the spare ribs. They were fall off the bone tender but WAY too sweet for me. Still, I ate them all.\n\nWe made a meal of just three small plates, so it was a great value.\n\nThe inside is strange--it's been vastly changed from the days it was Furio. I loved the new wall decorations. It's dark and could be romantic, if it weren't for giant TVs all over. That gave it a sports bar feel. Still, we give it an enthusiastic 4 stars!"

I will say the server was nice and they tried really hard.  They also had about 5 hostesses on staff so there was no wait to be seated.\n\nHowever--and this is a big however--the food was awful.  Awful as in the worst meal I've had dining out in years.  In addition to the tempura fried pickles missing the mark (batter was just odd), the Stella tap clearly being hooked up to the Bud Light keg (my palate isn't that refined but I can tell BL from SA) everything was not just \"meh\" but cooked in a way you would cook food for your worst enemy.  The baked beans were worse than the cheapest canned beans you could buy, the mashed potatoes LL ordered made instant potatoes desireable, and the mac n' cheese made me long for Kraft.\n\nBelieve it or not, with all this being bad--it's not the worse!  First, the HH specials are probably the weakest I've ever seen...why even have them?  The ONLY specials are domestic draws.  That's it.  Nothing off the $11 martinis.  Nothing off import drafts.  REALLY???  My last gripe is the entree, advertised as \"prawns\" with andouille sausage.  Not prawns.  Regular friggin' shrimp.  Maybe 5 total.   Drowned in oil.  On a stick.  $2 worth of food for $20.\n\nOh, and BTW the whole \"concept\" is everything goes on a stick (even the sandwiches).  And the whole focus point of the decor is some cheesy fire \"screensaver\" projected on a wall.\n\nSo in closing...I guess I was hard on the place.  But the server was nice.  If it's around next year the owner has some deep pockets.  You expect hiccups with a new place, but build-out on this took several months which is more than enough time to put together a menu.

The decor is dark and very wooden -- reminded a bit of an hipster version of Stuart Anderson's Black Angus. A couple of TVs played college football games. The music was Country and Western (Yawn).\n\nI ordered a spare ribs appetizer and a caesar salad. The salad was good. The ribs were great. They were fall-off-the-bone tender and had a wonderful sauce that was just perfect. Dollops of bleu cheese on the ribs was a surprisingly good complement to the succulent meat. The portion was entree sized too.  My boss was ecstatic about his dish as well.\n\nAfter the meal, we talked to the manager and asked him why more people weren't here. He said that they do incredible business at night. I also commented that he might want to lose the country music. \n\nI returned for dinner a few weeks later.  I ordered the ribs again, with grilled corn on the cob.  The ribs were again enjoyable, but the recipe seemed a bit different with more chipotle spice added.  The corn was very tender and tasty.\n\nMy very attractive server was also the daughter of the owner.  She told me they have only been in  business for 6 months or so.

There were 4 of us for dinner on Wednesday, and each one of us ordered something diffrent. The skewers amazing, the s'mores-- memorable. Mr. Owner came over and asked how were doing, the whole 9 yards. Definitely coming back multiple times."

The staff is friendly and overly accommodating it was so refreshing to find such a great establishment that also believes in supporting local produce, and meats.  We should help support them!  \n\nThey treat their customer's in a way I've not experienced in years, and as an event planner & producer, that really means a lot!  Each dish they brought out was better & better.  You have to have their charred onion bread pudding!  It's to die for!  Not to mention the beef was so tender you could cut it with a fork.  Loved the jalapeno poppers, but if you're not into hot, be careful they are caliente, but in a very good way! \n\nKudos to a job well done in putting this little gem together.  I loved every bit of it and thank you so much to Robbie, Jimmy and the crew.  I will definitely be back to help our local family owned business!  Go BonFire!"

Everything else was exactly the same, including the layer of grime over all the fixtures, walls, and flooring. I was willing to overlook that since we usually only do takeout anyway but once we ate our food my husband and I both agreed that we would not come here again. The quality of food has been going down the last couple of months but this was a new low. I have never liked the place itself but at least I thought the food was decent but nothing we ordered this last visit was even edible.  Dry, crumbly tamales, burnt tortilla chips, and carne asada that tasted like the meat had spoiled. The worst part was the crispy taco that was disgustingly soggy and filled with a substance that looked like dog food and tasted like what I would imagine that canned dog food tastes like. I mean, it was worse than Taco Bell. Seriously.\n\nThere still seemed to be a steady stream of people coming in the door, again mostly take-out orders, so I guess their customers are very loyal or else not everyone thinks it's gotten as bad as I do. I think most of their loyal fans keep coming back since it is so cheap, but there are lots of better options for cheap Mexican food in Chandler."

I agree with some of the other reviewers that the food is greasy and so that is what keeps me from eating here too often.  But it is no worse than Losbetos, Filibertos, or Nicos or the other authentic Mexican taco shops in the valley, but they have more options than just burritos and tacos.  And I think that their rolled tacos are the best!\n\nDefinitely not the nicest place to eat at - not dirty, just a little worn out an not comfortable.  They are really fast with the takeout orders so I recommend just showing up and grabbing some food to go.  I noticed last time that I was there that they will give you a free dessert if you pay with cash so keep that in mind when you go."

Espo's fit the bill on that account, and it has gotten some good reviews recently so I decided to try it out after shopping at nearby Chandler mall.\n\nRight off the bat, I noticed the place was kind of dirty. I wasn't expecting anything immaculate, but I've seen nicer Filiberto's. The tile floor badly needs a mopping.\n\nMy veggie burrito came out quickly and steaming hot. It was mostly a disappointment after that. First off, no sour cream or guacamole came with it which is my expectation for enchilada style. The red sauce was tasty with a very nice kick to it. I still added lots of salsa too which I also enjoyed. But there was way too much of the average tortilla, and the filling was a major letdown. Was I wrong to expect that a veggie burrito would contain veggies? Shredded iceberg doesn't count! The beans were too liquidy, and the rice had little flavor.\n\nThis place did nothing for me, but luckily there's plenty of other burritos in the sea."

The tortilla that my burrito was wrapped in was also excellent. Chips were ok. Next time we will skip the cinnamon crisps.\n\nI was a little worried about cleanliness issues, especially after I read the review about cockroaches. I opted against getting a drink, but everything appeared to be ok at least near the checkout area and the half of the kitchen I could see.\n\nThis is a much better alternative to the Filiberto's, etc. in this area of the Valley.

Then they give you a number and you hang out around back half till they call you.  I liked that they have lots of vegetarian choices ( for a mexican restaurant ) that are labeled on the menu, always nice.  They have a small patio outside which is pretty nice for the fall.\n\nI found the food pretty good for a fast food mexican place.

The other day I knew I would be in the area around dinner time and wanted to see if there was anything new in the area worth checking out....the reviews for Espos were all recent and talking about the awesome green chile (my personal fav) and how they had recently spruced up the place, so I decided to give it a try.\n\nThe interior is still very old school Mexico, but it was clean.  The banner outside says something like \"We have the BEST green chile\" so I definitely had to give that a try, I ordered the Green Chile Cheese Crisp (Quesadilla) and the cheese enchilada plate to go, the food was so cheap, it was like $10 for both!\n\nThe food smelled amazing on the long drive home to Scottsdale, and I couldn't wait to try it.  I went with the enchiladas first, many times what disappoints me most about enchiladas is the bland sauce, but this red sauce had a nice bit of heat to it and was really flavorful, I was pleasantly surprised how much I enjoyed my $3.85 enchilada plate!  I moved on to the Green Chile Cheese Crisp, my only complaint was that they had not cut it into pieces, it was just a giant folded over tortilla, but as soon as I took my first bite all of that was forgotten...it was AMAZING!!  It reminds me of something from my childhood, the beef was so tender and flavorful, it wasn't spicy but it had some heat, I was in heaven!  I didn't get a chance to try any of their refried beans, so that will be on my agenda next time, but I will always have to get something with the Green Chile!\n\nIf I lived closer to this place I would definitely be a regular, I will now be skipping Someburros and heading straight to Espos when I am in the area."

I had come here for (street tacos) carne asada tacos hoping I would find another joyous Mexican place I would be fond of.  Their carne asada had a very weird texture or lack of I should say with very little flavor or crispiness in the slightest its almost like they boiled it and threw it on the stove and swished it around til it got hot but not crisp obviously.\n\nIf their carne asada was amazing id be in heaven with how ginormous the size of those things are. I wish someone would have warned me that they are no where near street taco size they are like street tacos on steroids.  I am in love with the usual street tacos because my stomach will only allow a max of 3 in my stomach at a time.  The pico de gallo has a lot of minced jalapenos so beware. My spicy tolerance is slowly diminishing where I can no longer handle extreme heat like that. I do happen to like their red sauce though  it is spicy enough for me to handle to dip my not as spicy food into to add the heat with each bite.  \n\nNot much to really say besides I wasted a lot of money for two tacos. So overpriced and the longest wait known to man for 2 tacos. 30 minutes for 2 tacos is crazy.  I understand you are busy but 30 minutes really?\n\nI doubt ill ever return to this establishment."

If you like real Mexican food not taco bell type Mex! you will like Espos.  The prices are good for the amount of food they give you I order the carne asada combo plate and it comes with a free taco that's enough to fill up a big boy and have your old lady  hurting... But one problem most people face is You cant find the place, first off you would drive right by them and not notice it at all and its on Chandler Blvd. Go figure!!!  Its a family owned spot and even after the remodel it's still a dumpy looking rustic looking, greasy sticky tables and looks as if it could use a real good cleaning. There plain white walls (THAT'S NOT SO WHITE) and plain white painted building attached to a small market just looks dirty (and remember this is after the remodel) i guess they didn't want to change much about the establishment.

Before I could say anything, the woman behind the counter said bluntly, \"We're out of churros, so I gave you sopapillas.\"\n\nI thought about it for a second, and realized only a churro was really worth the extra flab my friends would see at the pool that weekend, and told her, politely, I'd really just prefer to not have sopapillas.\n\n\"You just want your dollar back?\" she barked, as if I had asked her to drive to the U.S. treasury to collect one. I said yeah, I just love churros, and don't think I need anything else.\n\nShe huffed to the register, grabbed a dollar, and handed it to me.\n\nNow look, one doesn't want to be petty, but really, the churro (after tax) costs $1.26. As I looked at her face that was saying, \"Why couldn't you just eat your damn sopapillas like I told you to?\" it occurred to me I shouldn't have to pay Espos twenty-six cents for a churro I never got.\n\n\"I think it was a $1.15 on the menu,\" I said.\n\nOh man, now she was pissed.

VERY bad customer service. If their food wasn't so good I probably wouldn't come back."

We had a fish taco, carne asada taco and the el presidente burrito and they all were excellent. We also got the chips, salsa and guacamole but we also added a side of their green chili that was out of this world!!\n\nThe have the bomb cocktails too! We started with their black cherry mojitos and ended with a drink called \"The Mail Order Bride\" that literally was so good I could have drunk ten of them! \n\nDefinitely my new fav Mexican food place!"

On the surface it's got a lot going for it; it's quaint and sufficiently run down enough to make you think it's one of those small gems, it's gotten great reviews\nIn the past, it smells like a good Mexican food place should, and it's been around forever. \nUnfortunately it did not live up to expectations. I got a bean burrito with sour cream and a large horchata. The tortilla was excellent, but the beans were so cold that they didn't melt (or ever warm) the clump if cold cheese inside, leaving me with what is essentially a burrito-cicle. I came in relatively early at 11:10 so I suspect that they just were not really ready for me. The taste wasn't bad, it was just that it was too cold to really enjoy. \nAs a sidenote, the horchata was so sweet that it was almost undrinkable, and had the taste and consistency of coffee creamer.\nWhat a shame."

This place has good food, served in disposable aluminum take out containers.  Again, the food was good, but greasy.  My party sat themselves and you go up to the counter to order and pick up your food.  The woman at the counter was helpful.  As a pescatarian, I can't say there were many options that satisfied my criteria.  This was a good place, in my opinion to get take out mexican, but a bit too much like burger king or McDonalds for a dine in place.   Plastic silverware, served to you on a cafeteria tray, etc. Also, no booze.  Sad Panda.  That said, there was a massive rush of people coming in around 630pm on Sunday.  Maybe the meat versions of their dishes are really good, but I wouldn't know.  It got a bit loud from the noise of the dinner crowd."

Espo's is not fancy, but in the 25+ years I've been going there, I've never seen vermin (as someone else reported). In fact, you can see the busy kitchen when you're standing at the order counter. My only complaint has ever been the sometimes long (15-20 minute) wait, but that is not surprising with such a small kitchen and such a large number of fans. Service can vary, but is usually hurried and curt at worst (sometimes; especially when they're busy) to laid-back and simpatico at its best."

Though on the weekends it seems they are on there game most of the time.  I too have had bad experiences with calling in a order and the order not being complete.  But i learned my lesson and tear it apart before i leave checking to make sure its correct.\n\nFast forward to yesterday, My coworkers and I were wanting a Espos fix.  I ordered a Carne Asada Chimichanga and a soda,  not my usual Chicken Enchilada Combination Plate. \n\nI also noticed that they now charge you 45 cents to run your card, I hate when businesses do that.  So all in all i spent about 9.31 for a soda and chimichanga. Which for me seems a little steep. I understand with the economy changes have to be made but hey thats alot of money!\n\nAlso the soda was out of CO2 so it took about 10 minutes for the girl to come out and change the tanks. Which for me was to long, as it wasn't overly busy. \n\nNow to the review of the food the chimichanga was covered in lettuce, cheese and sour cream.  I hate sour cream so i scraped it off, my fault entirely since i didn't ask them to leave it off.  The chimichanga was good but not the best. \n\nThings i liked \nsuper hot. \nspicy throughout\nfilling\n\nthings i disliked\nseemed a little dry, but not overly dry. \nto much sour cream.  But as i said my fault entirely. \n\nAnd the final take on the whole experience. I will probably be back but i will probably stick to my Enchilada Combination Plate."

It was spicy and a good flavor, but I wasn't loving the carne asada texture. And although the flavor was pretty good, it needed pico or guacamole or something to give you a break from the spice and the flavor. \n\nThe carnitas burrito was better, and the carnitas texture was great. Love that. But again, it needed something to mix it up a bit. It was just meat and spice. \n\nNext we got the green chile tamale. That was very good. But usually tamales aren't enough alone for me to love a place. \n\nReally what Espo's needs is a salsa bar with limes, different kinds of salsas, but especially some pico. \n\nFinally, the folks at the counter were nice. However the table was sticky and there were several flies buzzing me. It had an interesting smell that wasn't Mexican food. Not bad, but didn't make it more appealing either."

As I told this to the gentleman that took my order, his response was \"It hasn't changed at all (the food)\" and I totally agree. I remember way back then, I would look back into the kitchen and see Nana's, Mamas and Tia's cooking, which to me says this place is truly authentic.  I had ordered what I always got before, the green chile plate and just for funsies, I tried one of their green tamales. I swear the tamale tasted exactly like my Nana made every Christmas! \nThe green chili plate comes in a foil pan filled with the green chile, beans and rice. All the food touches so if you don't like that sort of thing... ask for them separated. Oh! I forgot to mention as I had also forgotten that it comes with a huge taco as well, I seem to remember them coming in shredded beef and this one was ground beef but it was still very delightful. \nI ate outside on the patio and it was a little loud but I was alone so if I had someone to talk to I probably wouldn't have noticed much. They gave me bottle full of green salsa to compliment the meal and I had bought a soft drink that was refillable. It was a small cup 12 oz I believe so I had to refill a lot since I'm such a wuss a eating real chile ( yah yah I know I know, I also don't speak Spanish either). \nAnyhow I noticed that you can buy the tamales by the dozen there, I'm not sure how much that would be since I know I paid something like 3 dollars for the ONE I had. I have to say, prices sure have gone up. I asked how much for a tortilla and almost choked when he said 3.95 or 4.95 depending on the size (12 in or 14 in). I said... uh maybe I'll just stop at Food City and get a whole dozen (but boy are they delicious). \nIn short. I love this place. It is not fancy, you can be very casual when going there. It is safe to say, this is the spot Hispanic people go to to get REAL Mexican food. Filibertos is kinda a joke in comparison to this place and be prepared to pay for the upgrade in flavor. \nI will definitely be back for more! As a matter of fact, I want more now!"

If that's the case, I'd hate to see what it looked like before.  Other than a thick layer of schmutz on the ceiling, there was nothing wrong, but certainly nothing inside looked remotely new.  \n\nI walked up to the window and ordered the green chile burrito (my standard for all Mexican restaurants), my daughter ordered the machaca beef burrito and a quesadilla.  Actually, she ordered the pork carnitas burrito at first, but they were out, so machaca would have to do.\n\nThe food came up quickly, and while the tortillas were excellent, the green chile was average at best without the kick I expected.  The machaca burrito was absolutely packed with beef (had to have 3x the beef of the green chile burrito) and was pleasantly juicy.  The quesadilla comes simply folded in quarters.  Initially I thought it was just an extra tortilla, but sure enough, there was a layer of the standard melted cheddar inside.  Actually, it was kinda of fun to tear off pieces of the quesadilla and dip them in the red chile sauce they provide alongside.\n\nBonus points for having Barq's Red Creme Soda in the soda machine; otherwise nothing to get too excited about, but nothing noxious either."

My wife gets the bean and cheese burrito and prefers it over Some Burros and Filiberto's. For dessert we recommend the sopapillas. Delicious. Get an ice cold Coca-cola in the bottle to top it off.

I have traveled up and down this state, Mexico, New Mexico -- and each and every Mexican food place in between it that has it, I order Green Chili.\n\nWhy Green Chili do you ask? Because at a young age growing up in Gilbert, I was already spoiled with a variety of foods mixed in between our cultures and any event is an excuse to chow down.  During a \"Gilbert Days\" years and years ago, I decided to have a Green Chili burrito from a stand on the side as I was starting to get sick of bean&cheese and red beef burritos.  When I bit into this burrito and started eating it, I had what some would call a monumental religious experience. My mouth exploded with such flavor and texture it compelled me to seek out this recipe with every fiber of my being henceforth. Once you have tasted it, you are forever changed. It caused me to try every green chili recipe I could (and most weren't suitable).  I tried to deal with Filberto's variant, too spicy at times, too chunky, meat was stiff.  I even kept going to Chalo's in Globe for their version which is comforting, not spicy. A friend told me my search for this Green Chili recipe was like Johnny Depp's character in 'Once Upon a Time in Mexico\"\n\nSkip to a few months ago..Wife tells me she sees this sign by Chandler Mall, just a few miles from us proclaiming their green chili is worthy of trial.  My interest was piqued. Could they provide something comparable to something that I haven't had in almost 2 decades?  We went there and I ordered the Green Chili plate and a real Coke(awesome).\n\nI took a slice of tortilla, dipped it in the mixture.  It seemed they cooked it properly with shredding the meat. texture looked perfect.  I bit into it and.....\n\nI am not absolutely clear what happened next, my wife tells me that my consciousness seemed to have gone somewhere else for a bit and when I came back, mentally, I could only mumble 3 words over and over \"this is it, this is it, THIS IS IT!\". I went right to the counter and told them the green chili they have is what I have been looking for all my life.  They looked at me like I was crazy but you know good food when you have it, you know great food when you have it and you know to compliment the cook when it does happen.  \n\nThe rest of the green chili I inhaled - now I don't mean that I ate it super fast and with gusto - I mean that I was eating it with such passion and fury that I subconsciously used my lungs to assist my mouth in placing as much of the Green Chili in each bite where it belongs, IN MY BELLY.\n\nThis is the place for your Mexican comfort food."

After doing some research online I found that Espo's had some positive reviews and figured it was worth trying out. I have been to the Chandler Mall many times and never noticed that Espo's was right down the street. I have to say, after seeing the exterior I was a bit apprehensive to eat there, but my mom has always told me that \"little hole in the wall places always have the best food.\"\n\n The interior was a bit smaller than I was expecting but it had a nice charm- I loved the different photos that were on the walls and the older look to it. The fact that you had to take the menu to your table to decide what you wanted and then walk up to order was a bit strange but it was a new experience and made it not so ordinary. The staff seemed very friendly and the food came out quickly. I ordered the Red Beef Tamale Plate ($8.85), my mom ordered the Green Chile Burrito ($4.95), and my boyfriend ordered the Green Chile Chimichanga ($6.95). The food was amazing! We each took turns trying each other's food and I can honestly say I loved it all. Everything had a great flavor, the burritos were nice and crisp, and the sauce that came with the tamale was wonderful.\n\n I'm so glad I discovered Espo's through a school project; I will definitely eat there again. I learned that you really can't judge a book by its cover, Espo's may look a little rough on the outside but they can make some delicious food! I would recommend this place to anyone who enjoys Mexican food; it is completely different compared to Arriba's, Someburros, etc."

If you went across the street to Pita Jungle to have a very similar meal, you'd pay about 20% more per order.\n\nThere's an open kitchen and everything is made fresh right in plain sight. Their food is always well seasoned and it's pretty healthy for a fast-casual place. Order yourself some Falafel while you await your salad or entree and ask for extra dipping sauce for it.\n\nThey do close at 8, the CFL lighting is not at all cozy and it gets really busy for dinner, however the food and service are so good that I don't mind.

Hummus worked well mixed in with the rice and meat. Falafel was served steaming hot, crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Its a toss up between the falafel at Chicago gyro and this one. Excellent meal for 10.99 (falafel included) and plenty of leftovers!\n\nBf got the gyro plate which was mighty tasty too! I think I might like the gyro meat a little better here because its a bit less salty than Chicago gyro but I'd have to do a side by side comparison to know for sure.

The service was very good and we got our food quickly.\n\nThey are grilling some great looking beef and chicken here, yet sadly I didn't see any lamb on the menu.  I had the tri-tip kebab sandwich and my wife had the gyro.  Both were very tasty but what really made the meal was the 10'' pitas they are making from scratch.  They have a 6\" pita that appears to be sourced from Kronos (the large Greek food supply company, not the young Titan and son of Ouranos and Gaea) but the 10\" pita is homemade and ridiculously good. It has more in common with a buttery roti than a pita. Big-ups to my friend Emir for cluing me in on them.  We also had the Flaming Feta, it was fantastic, we'll definitely be getting it again.  If you like heat, be sure to ask them for their Greek hot sauce, it was a very spicy green sauce that had a unique flavor that I really enjoyed.  The only downside to the meal was the quality of the veggies in the sandwiches.  The tomatoes were pale and mealy and the lettuce was a little wilted.\n\nI'll be returning to Greek Wraps, the 10\" pita is something I'll be craving until I have another crack at it.  There were also several other dishes on the menu that looked to have a lot of potential.  If you're in the area stop in and get some very good Greek grub."

To those of you who reviewed this place, I owe you one.\n\nShe got a 7\" pita, I got a 10\" gyro.  First off, my gyro was huge.  I never been so full from a gyro in my life.  Second, its true what the other yelpers say about this place.  All the food is made fresh right in front of you, which means its usually about 3-5 minutes until your order is ready.  The wait is worth it.  The gyro with two kinds of meat, lettuce, and veggies is booming with flavor.  Despite its sheer size, I demolished it.  Not as quickly as she demolished the pita, but she had a smaller portion so I'll call it a draw.  We both were more than satisfied.\n\nThe place is small and was extremely busy (on a Sunday no less), but the cooks worked pretty quick.  Meals are usually $5-$10 tops.  Mine was $8.  Probably wanna get here early for lunch as I'm sure its a zoo.

I LOVE this place. I've had Greek, Turkish and various Arabic cuisines in many cities and several countries, and the stuff they serve here is right up there with the most flavorful I've ever had.\n\nPrimarily, the fact that they make their own bread fresh to order is what gets me salivating when it's coming close to lunchtime. They have 7\" pitas or thinner 10\" wraps. I get the latter. They're delicious. I'll either get a chicken kabob or shawarma wrap, typically with a side of falafels and a side of dolmas (vine/grape leaves). Their vine leaves are the cold vegetarian versions; none of that disgusting hot stuff with pine nuts and meat. Falafels are excellent - they don't taste store-bought and sludgy but have great flavour with a very nice, subtle peppery aftertaste. The shawarma is fantastic - marinated enough to give it a delicious zing. Me eating a wrap is like putting a piece of paper in a shredder - I absolutely decimate the thing nonstop from start to finish and have to watch out that I don't chew my own fingers off towards the end. I've had baklava once or twice from here, it's not too bad either. And thank god they don't serve ridiculous Chicago-style hotdogs here. Last I checked, Chicago wasn't in Greece.\n\nGreek Wraps has always been extremely popular, especially at lunchtime, and it was always way overcrowded. The \"Jersey Shore\" (cracked me up) dudes prepping the food work pretty furiously but still it takes quite a while to get your meal, sometimes 10-15 minutes or longer. Toward the end of last year they did a MUCH-needed renovation and pretty much doubled the interior space - I remember walking in and then doing a doubletake since I didn't recognize any of it. Even with the added space it's still almost always full up at midday. Great prices, the absolute best Mediterranean take-out on the west side (I like Pita Jungle equally, but that's a different range/style of foods) and well deserving of your cashola. For dessert, assuming you have room (typically unlikely), you got your choice of a Jamba Juice or a Juju Berri in the same strip, or else walk across the carpark to Cost Plus World Market and pick up a coupla import chocolates like Milka Nussini or Cadbury Flake. Mmm.\n\nEdit 20110615: BLEAH!! T Greek Wraps now stocks the infamous Abali \"yoghurt soda\" which I first tried at Haji Baba's down in Tempe. Disgusting - BUT!! I was super excited to see it and actually bought a bottle to drink. Do not ask me why. I grimace every time I take a swallow of it, but maybe I like it because of the Warhead effect - some sort of mild endorphin rush you get from challenging your taste buds to something they aren't thrilled with. Anyway, add another imaginary star to my review just for this stuff alone. See my pic. http://j.mp/jIYTCK"

Landmarks would be: World Foods, Old Navy, Mattress Firm, Rubio's...it's in the back corner of the strip mall that houses these stores.\n\nAlrighty.  Service is quick and efficient.  A chicken shawarma meal is $8.18 with fries & drink.  The fries were not that great - I'd guess frozen from a bag.  The chicken in the shawarma was excellent and the pita bread was extremely good.  The problem is the rest of the sandwich.  There was not enough chicken, too much sauce (it was very drippy), and overall, not that satisfying.\n\nI would say that if I had gotten a plate of that chicken on its own with some of the fresh pita bread and some hummus, I could have easily given this place 5 stars.  But we're ranking them on the wraps, and when the food was wrapped, I would opt to try another place first."

But here, they do wraps with pita bread or their fresh baked bread. Definitely go for the later. It is more expensive than the pita bread but I think it's worth it - it's bigger so that's why.\nI got the chicken shawarma sandwich/wrap. The bread was warm and yummy. They loaded it with TONS of chicken. Almost to the point where it was a bit too much but that only makes it a great deal for your money. It was $7.49. \nThe only slight I had was that I always like dark meat over white meat. The description said it was made from chicken thighs.  When I got it, it was more like half and half.  That or half the dark meat was dry.  But that's minor since in most cases, that would be the better deal since white meat is usually more.  \nFriendly staff too."

For sandwiches, go for the larger \"wrap\" over the \"pita\" and take the leftovers to go; the tandoori-ed wrap _is_ that much better.\n\nMy eyes tend to be larger than my stomach, so I venture just beyond that 1$ mark; but there are certainly plenty of options within that price range.\n\nBe prepared for crowds.

Not worth it.  GREEK WRAPS IS FAR SUPERIOR.  Better than any we've had traveling cross country too.  The staff is friendly, but the place is a bit limited on size, so if you go when they are busy, seating could be a problem.  Don't go if you are in a hurry, getting your food always takes a while, but there's a reason - they don't just shave the meat off the spit, they shave it off than pan sautee it.  Everything they do is an extra step or two, which takes time, but makes it soooo much better.  Everything is fresh and spiced perfectly.  I've tried everything from their sandwiches, salads, plates and sides, and we've never had a bad meal there.  Even though it's an 'order at the counter' type place, nothing fancy, it's still one of our favorites because of the quality and the friendly staff.  Just really. good. food!"

My boyfriend, who is a VERY picky eater, was impressed with his gyro.  Overall, the meal was a great value and we will be back next time we're in the area.  One word of advice though...the portions are HUGE.  I ordered a 7\" wrap, which was too much for my little stomach and my boyfriend's combo came with a mountain of hot french fries.  If you are a big eater or like leftovers, you will be a happy camper!"

I've tired just about everything the have stuffed in the wrap...souvlaki, chicken shwarma, steak shwarma, gyro...and they are all delicious.

Our salads are custom made, since Mom and I can't eat green pepper; they are just like my grandma made in the 1950's!   The fish is grilled perfectly: flavorful and spiced just right.  The portions are large, and my family is happy because I am gluten free, so they get more of the special homemade pita that the restaurant is so famous for.  What I notice is that a lot of the EMTs and firefighters stop in for a quick meal. That is telling!  Yes, there is a few minute wait, but well worth it.    Ambiance is okay, its not a five star, but the price and value are great. Drink prices are $1.49 to $1.99.  The catering prices are a bit high, and they don't deliver, but I observe lots of people coming in for carry out.  Worth the drive from Sun City to Peoria.

The veggies were plentiful and fresh, and the flatbread was the perfect thickness--soft but not flimsy. The chipotle sauce was flavorful, with just the right amount of heat.  My only complaint is the smaller portion of chicken--more is always better.  Try the peppadew hot sauce on your meal!  Wayyyyy better than Tabasco. \n\nIt would be PERFECT if there was one located closer to Scottsdale...So many tasty options, all at very reasonable prices--$5 got me the wrap, a drink and my choice of chips, a cookie or a brownie.

I also like that Sandella's has calorie information posted and that the nutritional value of menu items is easy to find online. It is a little on the pricy side but no more than you would pay at Chipolte or Firehouse Subs. The customer service is great and I have never had a bad experience here.

The place was very clean, well staffed, friendly and definitely fast.  \n\nI had the provolone veggie panini and a side veggie soup.  The panini ingredients were fresh & flavorful, had a mildly spicy sauce and held together pretty well.  I enjoyed the sammy but it tasted...well...fast.  Sort of assembly line I guess?  Sadly, the soup was canned & bland tasting.  A couple of shots of hot sauce didn't bring it to life at all.\n\nIf I'm in the area I may go back again and try a different sammy and salad this time, hopefully they'll be a little more lively.

Totally chill and let customers take their time when deciding and also give good suggestions on what to get from the numerous menu items. 'Grilled flatbread' is basically your pizza sauce and toppings on pita bread, you can call it something fancy but when you get down to it that's all it is. For the price, not that great. But - the quesadillas are really good - super melty with awesome fusion of flavor on the inside with crisp flatbread texture on the outside. Usually get the Southwestern Quesadilla and it's been flawless all but once - one time they added too much salsa and it got soggy, so make sure to tell them to take it easy.\n\nGreat for a lunch outing with friends or just a place to grab a quick bite to eat. They market themselves as a healthy alternative if you're into that. Big plus for having Sriracha hot sauce available."

The noodles were cooked with a very hot wok to give it that heated flavour, but nothing was burnt. It was very sweet and white peppery and basily and garlicky. It wasn't wet and drenched with sauce either,and the noodle was cooked del dente. I hate it when I order drunken noodle and it's filled with large red and green peppers, but this dish had no peppers - bamboo shoots, carrots, green beans, and this type of dry corn i dont know the name of. So Good! I had to take away the fifth star as i ploughed on through my noodle though, as the pork and vegetables were not flavourful at all. I ended up picking out the noodle only and left the rest (I wasn't hungry anyway). I wish i can find drunken noodle like this everywhere i go.\n\nAfter tax, the noodle was less than $10 and i was pretty happily full. There were people coming in steadily throughout the night. The service can probably get a little spotty since there were only two people manning the floor and the dude waiter seemed young and very new to the job. He kept asking people if they wanted a table or booth even though the booth was full - kinda funny when you're sitting directly facing the front."

I believe we all had the pad thai (three of us). Nothing too difficult to prepare, but we left waiting... and waiting.... and waiting. I took an hour for our meal, which was too long for a smaller place without a lot of people on a a Friday evening. No less than 5 different wait staff attended to us at different times through the evening so they weren't understaffed. \"Our\" waitress (blond haired) apologized for the slowness and said she \"yelled at the kitchen staff for\" us.

One was ordering as I arrived, another was receiving their meal, and the third was well into their entrees.  At the waitstand, I picked up a paper version of their menu.  It is interesting how many restaurants change their prices in the 'table' version of the menu, but they ignore the change in their take away version.  These folks passed the price comparison.\n\nI was greeted by a friendly waitperson.  She brought me to my table, asked about my beverage preference and asked where I would like to sit.  I was seated at a 2-top (though the bench on 1 side apparently means something else in Restauranteeze) and placed my order, Som Tom, no green beans, no shrimp, and Thai hot along with a side of steamed rice.  Because I proceeded out of sequence, my waitperson was not ready; she got her pad and quietly let me know that this was her first day.  She asked me to repeat my order.  I did, and she thanked me for my patience.  Off she went, bearing my order to the kitchen.  She returned in a minute with water.\n\nAs I looked around, I counted table and seating space I could see.  18 tables, being for 2 or 4, benches and chairs for about 60 people.  Next time, I will take more time and see if there are other tables.  The plastic carafes full of water...no.  Most looked to be as full as they were when they were placed on the tables at opening.  As I waited for my order, I drained the glass and filled it from the carafe.  If there is any suggestion I would give, please put glass, ceramic or metal carafes out.\n\nSalad and rice arrived.  Nicely sized portions of each, about 1 1/2 cups of rice and 2 cups of salad.  On getting my first forkful of salad, I knew it needed more chile.  When I caught Waitperson's eye, she came over and I asked for more chile.  She said she would get more, turned to go and turned back, asking if I wanted fresh or dried.  This question was the saving grace, preventing a 1-star review.\n\nWaitperson brought out chopped fresh thai chili.  I incorporated this into the salad.  What started as a 2 was now a 6 in heat.  While the papaya seemed fresh, there were lots of bits of green beans.  To me, the better filler is carrot.  The texture is crunchier and the flavor is enhanced.  Probably the biggest challenge was the dressing.  The best Som Tom recipes show hints of garlic, lime, chili, palm sugar and fish sauce.  This version had fish sauce, sugar, chili and bottled lime juice.  It lacked the sparkle that should have gone along with the crunch.  Unfortunately, doctoring Som Tom with chili after the preparation is a marginal adjustment.  Having the chili in with the preparation helps the flavor spread throughout the preparation.  \n\nBeing spoiled by a native who enjoyed this salad as much as I did, the preparation here does not compare.  I must try Nunthaporn's again for other items.  As of now, 2 stars is the best I can give."

I made the right choice - I can't help but order the same thing every time (I can get pad thai and pad see ew anywhere, I haven't found any other place with the same recipe for this one.) I've tried bites of a few other things, though, and they've been pretty good too. \n\nHilariously, this year when I was back a couple weeks ago, we (this convention) basically ate all their food - by the time I got there, they were out of several things. They handled it well, though."

The only slight disappointment was the appetizer, Miang Kum.  When a dish states prawns as the second ingredient, I guess I expect a plump juicy prawn, not diced little bits of it.  Ah well, chock that up to unfamiliarity - will order Chicken Sa-Te next time!  The entrees we ordered, Pad Thai Shrimp and Pra Rham Chicken were excellent, the chili lime sauce on the latter was spicy and flavorful."

As you are looking over the menu, you are automatically served an appetizer and soup of the day. I've eaten here twice this summer and the food has been wonderful both times.  This last Friday I enjoyed a lunch of Massamon curry chicken in coconut milk with roasted peanuts, potatoes and onions with Jasmine Rice.  So good!  I treated myself to a glass of Thai ice tea--I think of it as a desert, because it is so sweet.\n\nCheck out this restaurant (I'm sure it will become a favorite) and then walk over to the Mesa Arts Center and see the exhibits at Mesa Contemporary Arts.

The service is great! Everyone greats you with a smile. Even when you walk by the kitchen you receive a warm greeting. Service I'd also fast, especially for take out orders. The restaurant is nicely decorated. Lunch here is cheaper than fast food and far more satisfying! Dinner is also a bargain with hearty portions. The pad Thai, red curry, evil jungle princess and lemongrass soup are all fantastic selections.

        "review": "I've had pretty good luck trying places with few reviews but high ratings, and Nunthaporn's is no exception.\n\nWe went at around dinner time on a weekday and found plenty of street parking right in front of the restaurant. \n\nThe inside is Thai reminiscent without being over-the-top or wannbe-trendy.  Plenty of seating and I didn't see any 2-top tables, which I like because I generally eat with a friend of mine and between the amount of food we order and how tall we are 2-tops generally make me claustrophobic.\n\nThe service here was great, prompt seating and order.  The menu is as expected for a Thai restaurant with about 60 dishes in all in various categories.  I had the red curry and my friend had the yellow.  We also had an order of 'Thai toast' which was a lightly fried pastry with chicken inside and covered in a sweet & sour sauce.  \n\nThe curry was delicious, though the menu lead me to believe it was going to be a little more spicy.  I have fond memories of eating in small restaurants in southern Thailand and having my tongue chemically removed by spicy seafood dishes.  Next time I will try the only item (that I saw) on the menu with a four star spicy rating.\n\nOn the way out I saw two separate large parties dining and they had ordered some dishes family-style, which came in large two-tier serving bowl/platters and looked extremely tasty, so I would definitely recommend bringing larger groups here.\n\nThe prices were very reasonable and I was really happy with the quality of the food.  I will definitely be coming back often, especially since Char's on Rural / University is gone.  Overall this restaurant is probably more of a 4.5 star, but I will round up this time to keep the rating :)"

        "review": "Thai food that delivers? Yes, please! Granted, it's not as good as Thai Spices, but it's still very passable. \n\nIt was one of those nights where there's no food in the house, and you're already in your comfy clothes, and you don't feel like getting dressed again to go out. So I needed to find something that delivered. I turned to my trusty Yelpers to see what was recommended. This place came up. It was Thai, it had a good rating and it delivered. Ok, let's give it a shot. \n\nI ordered chicken and oyster sauce and pork Thai fried rice. \n\nThe good: When the guy told me it would be here in 10-15 minutes, I chuckled, but it really was delivered within 15 minutes! A major plus, compared to the 45-50 minutes one usually gets quoted for delivery times. The food was good. Not great, but good. The portions were a good size, especially the fried rice. \n\nThe Not So Good: The chicken and oyster sauce could have had more flavour. This was one of my staples when I was living in Bangkok, so I know what it COULD taste like. It was pretty much just chicken and broccoli, and I was hoping for a little more. The $20 minimum for delivery, plus a $2 delivery charge is a little much. It basically forces you to order at least two entrees, even if you're just ordering for one person. \nThe menu items are a little pricey. We're talking $10 for fried rice, $9 for my chicken and oyster sauce. I don't mind paying if the food is worth it, but I'm still going with Thai Spices as the best Thai in town. \n\nBut, if you've got a hankering for Thai food and don't want to go out, then I'd totally recommend this place."

        "review": "I went here a month or so ago, and forgot to write my review, but I remember the whole lunch very well because it was such a terribly disappointing experience. I desperately wanted to like this place, because I work so close and love Thai food, but it was just not a good experience. The food wasn't horrible, but nothing that made me want to come back, and the service was awful. \n\nI'll start with the food. I ordered the Pra-Rahm lunch special. At the time I went, it was described as coming with a Spicy and Peanut Sauce. I took this as being one sauce, and this was exactly what I was looking for. However, when they brought it out, I found that these were two completely separate sauces. One was a very watery, spiced sauce, and the other was an incredibly thick, very sweet peanut sauce. The two didn't mix well, and neither really had that flavor I was looking for. The spicy one wasn't hot, rather just had a lot of spices in it. The peanut sauce was too thick and sweet for my tastes (would have been much better on top of some kind of dessert, in my opinion). The chicken and vegetables I had were cooked well, but I couldn't enjoy them because of the sauces.\n\nNow, I'll talk about the service. The entire place was being served by only two servers. Not that this place is huge, but there are probably 25ish tables in there, which is far too many for 2 people, if you want any service at all. On top of that, I managed to overhear one server talking and learned that one of the servers was training. So, really, there were only about 1.5 servers working. There is seemingly no organization as to which server helps with table, either. I walked in and was taken to a table by one server. I looked at the menu for a few minutes, decided on the Pra-Rahm, and set it down to wait for my server to return. 15 minutes went by before someone returned. The server that returned asked what I wanted to drink, and left. They came back with water, and didn't ask for my order, walking away again. It wasn't until I had been sitting for about 30 minutes that someone took my order. That, to me, is an absolutely ridiculous amount of time. Every time one of the two servers working walked by, they would make eye contact, and then look for the other, like they thought the other person was supposed to be taking care of me. It's not that they weren't friendly on the rare occasion that they made it to my table, they just didn't take care of their duties as servers. I could see the manager working, handling the to-go orders, but she wasn't doing much. You would think that the manager would help serve, since that was where the restaurant really needed help (not many to-go orders coming through), but she just watched and walked back into the kitchen. I was more patient than many others who had come in after me, as I watched them leave, but I wish I had followed their lead, because I probably would have ended up at Sweet Cakes, which is next door. Some of you think that the manager probably had other things to do, they couldn't possibly help, but that isn't true. I worked in a restaurant for almost 2 years, and during the meal rushes is usually the least busy time for managers, they end up helping out everyone else most of the time. Its toward the ends of the shifts and days that they have a pile-up of managerial duties to take care of.\n\nAll-in-all, this was just a terrible experience, and I can't see myself returning here when I can guarantee a great lunch experience next door at Sweet Cakes."

I was totally wrong! It was very delicious and I would go back there just to get more.\n\nI also ordered a spicy chicken dish with baby corns, lime basil, green beans and bamboo shoots which was also very tasty. It did have slivers of ginger through out, but if your not a fan, they are easy to avoid. \n\nThe only reason I give them 3 stars (really it's a 3 &1/2 star) was because it was a busy night and service was just a little slow.

Our main courses were a green curry with chicken and fish salad. The curry was lacking something, maybe too much curry and not enough other sauce as it was a dark green. Fish salad was not appealing either. My daughter liked the kids meal of chicken satay. Towards the end of the meal I pulled out my phone and looked this up on yelp.

You will not have this problem with Nunthaporn.  The food is flavorful, the staff is helpful, their Thai ice tea is DELISH!  My favorite Thai restraurant as far as the food goes.  The decor is cute but they are a little understaffed.  Either way, it doesn't stop me from eating there.  I just choose to go during a less busy time of day."

Out of my general range, and construction woes keep me away.   Went there today, after a long drive from Payson ,and had to pick up car from $1,000 repair, so was in area, with mom, and thought yum.  Went thru the back door.  about 10 people standing up front.  Asked them, what is wait? they said don't know, have been standing here at least 10 mins, some longer.  many empty tables, but full house waiting.  One waiter, and I guess a table clearer?.  We decided to leave, walking towards back, waiter stopped us and said, can put you at a table and bring water but 30-35 mins for food. Asked if someone out sick? He said no ,normal. That is just unacceptable.  was 1240 pm when got there.  If that is common, they need more wait and kitchen staff.    Mom said, lets just try it -so sat.  Many people upset, some leaving as soon as they came in after talking to those up front. .  Waiter and clearer working like crazy, seemed frenzied, stressed, and thought both were going to bolt out the door.  Lady next to us w/husband left, had to get to dr apt, so had finally gotten soup, but never got lunch.  She told husband to bring it home. Both were really upset.  Staff kept apologizing.   Finally, the  clearer guy, brought us soup about 25 mins after sat down.  It was not even warm.  spring roll came with, dry, chewy and barely warm.  then food came.  I ordered Evil Jungle princess that I get there often.  Didn't look remotely the same.  My mom said, that isn't what you ordered, tell him.  I said no, will just eat it.  Not going to wait for another order.   As long as no seafood all thai to me is good, and I was having a bad day already. Wouldn't have mattered as we couldn't get him to come back, glad some water on table for refill. The  restaurant started  clearing out, some sort of calm returned and we were able to pay bill.  but all in all stressful, disappointing experience for all the diners, and felt sorry for the staff.  Mom liked her food, other than wasn't very warm.  But she remembers it \"being so much better last time\".  So another thai restaurant crossed off the list. Don't think would even eat there if needing something before Mesa theater play"

I always get the Pad Thai and my friends get the Cashew Chicken.  For $7.50 you get a bowl of soup, some wontons, and a spring roll to start.  Then you pick your entree.  The soup is a simple broth with some veggies.  Light and easy.  The spring rolls are so good.  Fried to perfection.  The Pad Thai is the best I've ever had.  The rice noodles are tossed in a delicious peanut sauce.  Mixed with onion, bean sprouts, tofu, and your choice of meat (I always get the chicken).  They always give you a huge portion which is great.  You can take almost half of it home with you.\nThis is just a nice place for lunch or dinner.  It's clean, the service is great and fast, and it's right off Main Street.  Also, they have a lunch punch card.  Once you get 10 lunches, you get a free one!  Pretty cool."

I came in here only expecting to glance over the menu and ended up dining in. This is the first time I have ever eaten Thai food and it was a fantastic experience.\n\nAs a vegan, it can be difficult to find restaurants with a lot of vegan options. But this restaurant has numerous vegan options and I found them to be very accommodating to my lifestyle. They answered any questions I had about what was in the food. I ordered the spring roll appetizer and the Pad Lard Na with tofu.\n\nWith every order, they give you a complimentary cup of soup and an egg roll/spring roll. The soup was steaming hot and tasty and the spring roll was also good. They also provide sweet chili sauce to dip the spring roll in.\n\nI actually preferred the complimentary spring roll to my spring roll appetizer. If I had known you got a spring roll for free, I probably wouldn't have ordered the appetizer. The presentation of the spring rolls was beautiful and the sauce they came with was great. The spring rolls taste a lot better dipped in the sauce, so don't forgo it if you get them!\n\nThe Pad Lard Na comes with sauteed flat rice noodles with sweet soy sauce, broccoli, Chinese broccoli, baby corn, and mushroom soy bean sauce. My only  two complaints about the dish are that I was expecting it to be firm tofu instead of soft tofu, and that there was a bit too much sauce. Other than that it was everything I had hoped for! The vegetables were cooked perfectly, the sauce was sweet like I expected, and it was a very large portion! Definitely worth $10.\n\nThe only mistake the server made was giving me a diet coke instead of a sprite but quickly remedied it by giving me what I had ordered. I found the service to be excellent and gave them a tip over 25%\n\nIf you're ever in the mood for Thai food, try this place out! I know I will be returning."

Thats right they breaded over the shell. You had to peel the breading off so you could take the shell off.  What a friggin mess.

The garlic noodles were once actually garlicky are now just slippery and greasy. The Honey Lemon chicken is now overcooked and has lost nearly all of it's unique sweetness. The most egregious difference is that the new ownership has entirely removed the Cajun potatoes from the selection of sides available.\n\nIf I were to write this review a year ago, I would have agreed with the other review by W.

Julia and I were in that \"I'm so hungry I'm cranky\" mood, so I stuffed my face with the chips forever.  Fresh baskets were brought often, as well as each of us getting our own salsa bowl.  Oh, and a complimentary bowl of guac can't hurt, either!\nThen the entree came.  I was wanting ooey-gooey, cheese-smothered enchiladas.  I got the mushroom and spinach.  It came with a side of black beans and rice.  The enchiladas were made properly: the tortillas were soft-fried properly before adding the fillings.  But, not a lot of stuffing!  A few mushrooms, a few leaves of lettuce and that's pretty much it.  They were \"covered\" in a green sauce.  BARELY covered in green sauce.  I was disappointed, to say the least.  The rice?

Perhaps I shouldn't black ball this place any longer?? Help me to over come!! \n\n\nWell, I never! LOL! Tradiciones.. good food, good service, if you're Hispanic.. I sent an email to the manager with no reply and no surprise. I thought I would share my experience with you.\n\nDear Mr Braden,\n\nI wanted to share our experience last night at Tradiciones with you. We have several friends coming in from out of town so the past Friday I had lunch and your wonderful restaurant. My friend and I had a exceptional time with great service (Mario was our sever) spot on menu items and overall were both very impressed. So I went ahead and made a reservation for a party of 15 with much excitement and anticipation. This type of excitement comes from years of dining and being a huge food enthusiast or foodie as my friends call me. This experience is in stark contrast to what happened last night.\n\nMy excitement carried with me the whole weekend so I decided to take my significant other there to have the same pleasure I had. Upon arrival we were amazed how busy it was and knew that a wait was imminent. After about 10 minutes I was able to make it to the front desk to put my name in for a table for 2. The hostess smiled at me and I told her 'dos', she raised her finger up to me and said \"uno momento\". Then she walked off and got another hostess, this was confusing as when she returned she started taking names of other guests and ignored me. Finally the new hostess asked me what I wanted. I told her I wanted a table for 2 she then told me that there was at least an hour wait. This was pretty obvious judging from the tens of other folks waiting for a table. Meanwhile the other hostess continued taking names then finally she added mine. I told her that we were actually here before the other guests the other hostess had written down. She ignored this and put my name on the bottom of the list. I'm not sure why she was acting like this towards me as there didn't seem to be a problem with any other guest besides the fact that I didn't speak Spanish. Our first instinct was to simply leave as it was perceived by us that we weren't welcome here. We stayed as the atmosphere still seemed lively and the smell coming from the grills were intoxicating.\n\nAfter walking around the courtyard and enjoying some of the vendor stalls there we decided to venture back in so we wouldn't be missed. As we were standing there waiting I noticed that the patio only had a few tables and wasn't very busy at all. So we asked the second hostess if we could sit out there. She came back several minutes later to tell us the patio was understaffed and she couldn't seat us there though she offered bar seats instead. Perfect! We we're sat at the bar and were both excited to try the Cilantro Margarita! We ordered then, I saw her mixing it up, my mouth started to drool. She  then presented the drinks to us, cheers!  The drinks were wonderful and I'm not a big sweet drink fan. I then looked straight ahead and saw our bartender enter an order into the computer. As I watched her type I was amazed to notice that she named the check \"Dos Gringo's\"! Looking around I could tell she was referring to us as everyone else around us looked to have been there for a while. She turned around and I asked her \"Dos Gringo's\"? She smiled and started laughing like I caught her doing something wrong. She tried to explain that she gives everyone nick names and didn't make any apologies to us for the name.\n\nIs it acceptable to call your non Spanish speaking guests Gringo's? I felt this was very offensive as I have generally heard the word in derogatory terms. Though this seemed to make sense as the way were treated at the hostess desk, were we just not welcome here? I continued to stew on this experience all the way until this morning when finally I decided to look up the word gringo to see if I were off base for my feelings. This is what I found...\n\ngringo(gr&#301;ng'g&#333;) n.pl. gringos Offensive Slang, Used as a disparaging term for a foreigner in Latin America, especially an American or English person.\n\nThis solidified my feelings so I finally did some soul searching and decided to share our experience. If this definition is the case we will no longer visit your wonderful establishment, perhaps this will make a others more comfortable? If you can please help me to understand the term and the way we felt leaving last night I would truly appreciate your time.\n\nKind Regards,\nFoodiebear"

There is a courtyard area with outdoor seating and shopping.  Colorful, traditional hispanic/latino/mexican culture shows here, and you feel like you've been taken to another country when you walk in.  Colorful is an understatement.  rich deep colors run through this location, along with beautiful traditions of hispanic culure cannot help but to seep into your bloodstream.\n\nIn the courtyard area, there is a grill that the staff cooks on.

Beautifully decorated dining area, with a bar area, solid wood seating for parties of any size.  Servers are all dressed again in the traditonal latino dresses, and while I was there on a Saturday night , there was also a mariachi type band playing.\n\nThey have a good selection of food, from Enchiladas, burritos and fajitas to mararitas and salsa.\n\nI ordered the shredded beef burrito.  The serving was ginormous, and HOT when the food came out.  Even though we were seated immediately, there was two large parties dining ahead of us, so we had somewhat of a wait for our food to arrive.  Thats okay, because we were so entertained with the mariachi band, it passed by quickly. \n\nThe food was delicious!  Portions were huge, and I took home enough leftovers for a full meal the next day.  you will NOT go hungry while dining here, and the atmosphere is contagous.  You cannot help but to get caught up in the moment, with the beautiful colors, music, and lively atmosphere at this place.  \n\nI reccomend this place for everyone, as i think its one of the more \"one of a kind\" establishments in this town.

That is one star. \nWhile having just stopped in at the Ranch Market to pick up a few groceries, I was going to eat at the Market itself but decided to maybe try a place I had never tried near by instead. As I took my groceries to the car, I decided that since I had not yet tried \"Tradiciones\" I would give them a try. \nI enjoy the food at the Ranch Market-- tasty and authentic.  Since they are connected I THOUGHT the food would be the same. Boy was I wrong!  I don't know who they have cooking here, but with all the great stuff they have next door it should be A LOT better. \nThe salsa should have been the first clue...it was just ok.  Again, knowing what they make in house next door, made this salsa pretty sad.  Wanting an Agua Fresca to drink and again knowing next door had like 7+ varieties, I was disappointed they only had horchata and pina here. I got the pina, which was probably the best part of this meal. \nI was really craving some tacos, and noticed they only really offered them under the appetizer menu as street tacos. Also wanting to have a sopito, I thought WTH I will get the sampler platter and add a taco. \n\nThe platter came with 2 mini chimis, 2 mini taquitos, 2 mini cheese enchiladas and a soptio each of chicken and beef. All looked good when it came out. I enjoyed the taco first...the last thing I was to enjoy on this culinary outing. Then, digging into the chicken enchiladas, the sauce was a \"mole\". This was not a good mole...way too sweet, someones idea of a mole. Yes, just because a mole has chocolate doesn't mean it's a chocolate sauce.  And the chicken, stringy bland kinda tough. Everything followed suit, bland not very authentic, someones idea of mexican food. It all reminded me of something I would get if in the Mid-west somewhere and wanted Mexican food...not Arizona! \n\nThe only saving grace to this meal was that it was happy hour on a Saturday and the platter was 1/2 off and the taco was a buck so I left paying only $9 instead of $15. \n\nWhile I will continue to eat at the Market....I will pass on TRADICIONES...*blegh*."

I am a sucker for strolling mariachis, mamacita servers in red frilly dresses, festive digs and authentic and delicious Mexican food.  Usually one or some of those elements are missing from your typical Mexican restaurant. It seems like not much to ask for, but I can't seem to get it all at once in Phoenix.  They even somehow manage to pull it off without seeming cheezy or contrived.\n\nI'm not that surprised though. Tradiciones IS right next door to Phoenix Ranch Market, which was accurately described by Mr. K as Mexican Disneyland and is what Food City wishes it was.  Since the entire strip is a renovated K-Mart from back in the day, Tradiciones has taken over the old Garden Center space, which you'll notice is now a cool plaza-style patio with space for a band. It's hard to choose between their inside or outside, but indoors is where you'll find the lunchtime buffet if you're in a hurry, and a high ceilinged dining room and more Mexican murals and colorful decoration you can imagine.\n\nI was here most recently for a business lunch with suits and formality and all that mess. \n\nFood highlights include the Bistec ala Mexicana simmering in a red caldo of veggies and sauteed beef strips (reminiscent of my mom's btw), the pollo margarita simmered in margarita mix with chipotle ranch and queso fresco was ok, but the clear winner was the seafood enchiladas (shrimp and veggies in a lobster cream sauce) - simpler than how they do at Barrio, but every bit as good.  I really enjoyed the fresh lemonade.  This place also passed my Mexican litmus test of beans, rice and tortillas (they have to taste at least as good as my grandma's).  If a restaurant can't master those staples, then it's a hopeless effort.  \n\nThe servers here are quick and courteous, but speak Spanish for the most part. The food was about a solid 4 stars, but the service, decor, atmosphere and just plain real-ness elevate it further to 4.5 stars."

I was exhausted and hungry. We were greeted and led into a HUGE dining room. I knew I was going to fall in love. Did I like the dumb dresses the ladies have to wear? No, but it makes the tourists and non-hispanic people feel comfortable. \nI usually set my bar on the quality of food based on the chips and salsa. We were served a fresh basket of chips and each given a personal bowl of salsa! Hooray for double dipping! The manager was walking around and he stopped by to say hello and then brought us a complimentary bowl of guacamole With three lovely ladies each with a fab pair...of.... I mean each with great personalities, what do you expect? So far so good! I had a margarita that was served in a martini glass full of ice... hmmm is that weird to anyone else? Oh well. The marg was good! \nFor my entree I chose the enchiladas suizas with chicken. What I was served was definitely YUMMY! The tortillas were fresh and they were soft fried. Fabulous, authentic touch! The suizas sauce was slightly tangy. The tanginess was offset by the cotija cheese that was generously sprinkled on top. The word that came to mind every time I took a bite was \"creamy\". It was a very well made enchilada. The beans and rice were pretty good too. Here's my thing about re-fried beans. I like them when they're made with manteca (LARD) *GASP* and these were more than likely made with them. The re fried beans were flavorful. The rice was eh.. ok. It was rice. I sort of wished for a bit more spice in the rice, but again, it makes the tourists feel safe. \nAn added bonus were the roaming musicians that they had. I was relieved to see that they were not in Mariachi suits but rather nice slacks and blazers and they were SINGING it. I wish I had more energy because I would have been whistling and doing a good ol Grita Mexicano along with the guys at the bar that were enjoying the entertainment! I look forward to enjoying Tradiciones again!"

They want it to look authentic, but it is like Macayo's with a cooler looking establishment.  Won't be back.  Boring food...Tourist attraction to bring people from Idaho to see.  Good chips and salsa though, I give them that.\nIt is not authentic, it just looks authentic to fool tourists.\n\nOh yeah, the Fundido was a cardiologists dream come true.

If you get the impression that you are amidst a food operation staffed by thousands, you are correct: several hundred are working in the kitchens next door making tortillas, cheese, asada, aguas and more!\n\nIf you don't have a filthy-rich Mexican relative with a hacienda (Mexican mansion) across the border, this may be the closest you'll get without an invitation. The mostly-abandoned courtyard is centered with a gigantic fountain, lined with what could be booths for a seasonal market, bodas, or other festival. In the corner a lush garden with a somewhat secret door leading to la sala, the grand room.\n\nDon't miss the Ranch Market next door; you won't see retail food sold in this quantity anywhere else in town.

They also loved the whole look and feel... just not the food.  It's a shame, since this really could be a regional gem where you take visitors (and locals who rarely leave their burbs) and really wow them.  I keep going back because the next door market is also one of those unique-to-PHX experiences.  However Tradiciones is not delivering on the food.  The menu sounds good.  It looks good.

The waitress barely acknowledged us and then completely disappeared midway through our meal. We tried in vain to get the attention of several others, including a manager, to get our check. We ended up waiting at least half an hour, and that was after my husband got up and convinced someone to give a &^%@#.

So I suggested Ranch Market and she agreed, as we parked I saw the sign that said resturant, and I thought this location didn't have a deli like the one on the South side does - and we were confused. We chose to just give it a try. And we stepped one foot beyond the large corridors and it was so COLORFUL!\n\nThis is what I mean by the 'hood being colorful, but here - you could actually SEE all the colors and it was beautiful. We wandered around and saw the cool stuff they have outside in a lil shopping area. But it was empty! We were worried that they were closed but trugged on ahead. waay in the back was the entrance of the actual resturant. \n\nWe were warmly greeted and seated right away because, at 4:30PM on a Tuesday - they were very empty... there were only 3 tables occupied in their very nicely decorated dining room which was very clean and even boasted a mural. Loves it! :) \n\nour waiter brought us some chips and salsa but the salsa lacked a kick, it's never hot enought me (that sounded dirty didn't it?!) haha! So I asked for something spicer - he gave me a look of concern and said they had habenero sauce... BRING IT! I was excited... the H-Sauce was KILLER!! But oh - so - freakin - good!! I loved it! i started mixing sauces and dubbed myself the Salsa Alchemist! :D \n\nAfter an entire bowl of chips, our food was ready. I had the Sampler Appetizer and it was very good. My mom had the combination with a Red Tamale, cheese enchilada with rice and beans. My sampler appetizer was sooooo good! The Flautas were nice and crispy and the seasoned chicken was awesome and went better with the mild sauce. The mini beef chimi was the BEST damned chimi I ever ever had! I wanted to pack the rest of my meal to go and order a chimichanga and eat that! lol! I had to have my mom sample it and she loved it too! The Sopricitos were AMAZING! I never had anything like that before. The waiter explained that they were a very thick Corn tortilla topped with seasoned chicken, lettuce, tomato, queso fresco & tomitillo sauce. I will definatly go back just for this dish alone! And as if that wasn't enough - the chicken enchiladas were very good, but the sauce was very deep... it had a very dark flavor. Almost too dark, I would have liked for it to have been a lil lighter in flavor. But it was still good.\n\nMy mom enjoyed her tamale but felt it was a tad too dry, she wanted red sauce but chose not too ask for it because she felt the enchilada sauce was way too strong for the tamale. She didn't really like her chese enchilada and didn't finish it. But she liked the beans and rice. and really enjoyed the automosphere as well as the chips and salsa. \n\nInspite those small faux pas, I'm still giving it the full 5 stars because the service was SO amazing. It's been a while since I've had exceptionally great service. Everything was spot on... \n\nTo my fellow yelpers: you MUST go and enjoy yourself! However, they have crazy-funky hours so look out for the signs that indicate whether or not they're open. I hope more people give this place a go - with the economy the way it is, I'd hate for this place to close because no one's going! And don't be afraid to ask for the Habenero sauce, yes it's melt your tounge atomically hot, but ask for an empty salsa bowl and start mixing the sauces and get your salsa alchimist on!!"

This one has intrigued me for awhile because it is consistently rated as one of the best Mexican places in Phoenix by the Arizona Republic, yet Yelp reviews are mixed. I kind of get that now. \n\nFirst of all, when you walk in they have meat cooking over a wood fire, which is a really nice touch. Even as I write this, I still have a slight campfire smell on my shirt. The d\u00e9cor is more or less your typical American Disney-like Mexican restaurant ambience, maybe a step above the norm. I was on my lunch at work so I could not drink, but I noticed Dos Equis on tap, which is always a plus in my book. The place is pretty large, so it would be a good destination for a group. \n\nService was very good and friendly. The prices were pretty decent for lunch, at least; I did not see the dinner menu. I had the carne asada platter with chilaquiles ($10.95) and my co-worker had a burro. The food was good. It was not super great, certainly not one of the best in town as AZ Republic suggests, but certainly a step up from Macayos and other chains. I think this would be a good place to impress out-of-town relatives that are not ready for super-authentic Mexican food. I'm not saying there is not authentic stuff on the menu, it's just that there is plenty of the stuff people would be used to seeing at a place like Garcia's. \n\nI would almost bump it up to four stars just because of the nice smell, the good service, and most of all, the proximity to the Ranch Market--the most wonderful supermarket chain in Phoenix."

I couldn't believe that I was in the same building as the Ranch Market.\n\nI was so mesmerized by the beauty of the location, and the display of a gajillion tequilas, and the music of the roving mariachis, that almost any food set before me would have been forgiven.  Almost.  The chips and salsa were okay, but my entree was really disappointing.  I ordered the spinach enchiladas and got a bland enchilada with barely cooked button mushrooms and hardly a shred of spinach! Seriously. I expected to bust into my little rolls to find a plethora of greens, but actually had to dig and search for a mere shriggle.  And the beans and rice were mediocre at best.\n\nBut, I must confess, my partners pollo looked incredibly tasty and he said it was.

Everyone was really nice and the service was great. The mariachi music was awesome, although I'm glad they didn't come over and try to convince us to get a serenade -- I hate that. It makes me uncomfortable...anyhow, the chips and salsa were top-notch. But the meals were just OK. My spinach and mushroom enchiladas had a good green sauce, and I was pleasantly surprised to see they weren't stuffed full of copious amounts of crappy cheddar cheese. Instead they just had *some* white cheese, which was nice. My husband ordered some chicken dish that came with a stew (sorry, can't remember the name). He liked it. We each had a margarita, as I wanted to try the cilantro margarita, but I wasn't too impressed. Granted, for $7, it really packed a punch, but the flavor wasn't too spectacular. Overall, I'd say the atmosphere adds another star to what I would consider a 3-star meal.

The entrance leads you through an open courtyard where vendors sell items in makeshift shops and you can watch them make the tortillas fresh and grill the meat. The smell makes your mouth water in anticipation.\n\nFor starters, the complimentary chips and salsa are better than at most Mexican restaurants. You can tell the chips are made from their fresh tortillas - they're thick, crunchy and perfectly salted and the salsa verde is addictive.\n\nI've had a few dishes here, but one of my favorites the pork carnitas.

The Spanish translation to this phrase is \"Seafood gives Life\".   Ironically, this is what this restaurant is missing... life.  Made the mistake of taking some out of town relatives to eat here.  One in the party had been here before when it was Tradiciones and fell in love with the patio and the \"Mexicaness\" of it all.  Is Mexicaness a word?  I don't think so but I like it.   We ordered fried tilapia, fried red snapper, two chicken quesadillas, one carne asada platter, one chicken burrito, one Modelo Negro beer and one margarita.  All the dishes were accompanied by a fake yellow rice and refried beans.  These have to be addressed first.  I say fake yellow rice because they were trying to make the typical mexican rice but failed.  The rice was plain, saltless white rice with a few peas in it.  A mexican place that doesn't know how to make a flavorful yellow rice?? Shame, shame muchachos.  What a flavorless scoop of I don't know what!  Really?  I told the cook I would gladly come by free of charge and teach the cooks how to make really really good yellow rice but she just listened and then said she would tell the cook.  \nAnd now for the refried beans.  Mushy, flavorless, saltless something.  If I had had a blindfold I NEVER would have guess I was eating beans.  Beans can be soooo delicious made with tender loving care and seasoned properly with garlic, onions and yes...something called salt.  \nThen for the carne asada, AKA, shoe leather.  Thin slices of beef with NO salt or pepper, or any seasoning for that matter.  Telling the waitress that it was overcooked and tough when she asked how the food was did not help.  She just walked away.  Was she muttering \"that's how we always make it\" under her breath as she walked away?  The two fried fish dishes lacked salt, were overcooked and a tad greasy.  The quesadilla & burrito were passable but nothing  worth a return visit.  However, the MODELO NEGRO beer was EXCELLENT and that's how this restaurant earned its ONE star rating.  \nBTW, the chips were fresh and plentiful.  So if you want to go to a restaurant just for chips and water, you are good to go at this place.\nMARISCOS VUELVE LA VIDA, contrary to its name, will be on its last legs shortly. We should start calling the EMT's now and give it some mouth to mouth.  It is going to need it."

        "review": "Here is how you eat at Tradiciones: Select group of people, preferably more than two. If all are drinking, order pitcher of margaritas, ideally fruit flavored.  Mango is an excellent choice.  Order appropriately sized Parillada (family platter) accordingly.  Platter for 2 comfortably feeds three or four.  Platter for 4 comfortably feeds six to eight.  The platters prompt you to pick three meats. I highly recommend the shrimp, pork and chicken.  Mexican sausage is also good, but not as universally crowd pleasing.  You will automatically get chips and two kinds of salsa (one green, one red) which in my opinion are quite good. With the platter you receive tortillas (I prefer flour(I also prefer parentheses, apparently))rice, beans, guacamole, nopalitos, grilled tomato, and grilled onions.  This is all served on a cast iron skillet of sorts, placed on top of a candle-based warmer. Embrace the fact that the mariachi band will come to your table and want to play a song and ideally solicit a couple bucks.  Know a mariachi song, request it and enjoy it.  You are essentially in Mexican Disneyland.  Eat until you are ready to bust.  To avoid an unfortunate food coma driving disaster, wander around the attached Ranch Market grocery store marvelling at the brightly colored pastries, tortilla conveyor belt and whole cow head in the butcher case. Revel in the fact that the two person platter is only $24.95, the four person platter $48.95, and fruit-flavored margaritas for four were $24, blow the savings on Mexican candy or a Spiderman pinata. Drive home, pass out with a giant smile on your face.  \n   Sunday Brunch is also really good.  Incredible variety of food, including an omelette bar and chocolate fountain, last I checked all for $14.95.  I kind of blew the climax of this review with the brunch thing didn't I?"

I was craving some real Mexican food and from reading the reviews on Yelp and also the recommendations of the person sitting next to me on the flight down here, I called for directions while waiting for my luggage and my sister and I went there for lunch.\nI don't know what constitutes good Mexican food in Phoenix, but I wished we had gone to Taco Bell instead.  \nWe both ordered the same combination plate of shredded beef taco and tamale.  We also ordered something called queso fundido and 2 margaritas.  \nFirst of all, the place is very festive and decorated nicely....that's really the best I can say for the restaurant.\nThe margarita was good, nothing spectacular, but good.  Now for the food:  Everything we ordered came all at once.  So, we got the fundido and it was served in a basket with the melted cheese in a crock on top of the flour tortillas...hmmm...where do you think that crock had been sitting before being put on top of food?  The \"tacos\" were dripping with grease and if there was meat inside, it was hard to find.  But the worst of the meal was what was being passed off as a tamale.  It was a chicken tamale, which where I come from (Tucson) is NOT a traditional tamale filling and the menu never mentioned it would be a chicken tamale.  It was dry and absolutely flavorless.  We had to use salt to give it some kind of flavor!  Did I mention the service was lousy too?  Couldn't wait to get out of there.\nCrossing this restaurant off as a food destination when visiting Phoenix!"

Next time we will eat outside. We shared a special platter which included your choice of 3 meats/fish out of 6. We had carne asada, white fish and shrimp. It was served with these amazing grilled squash and onions and tomatos and jalapenos with a delicious mild and spicy cactus warm salsa which was completely delicious. Lived in AZ most of my life and never ate Cactus before except as a Jam. The food was incredible. The beans and rice so delicious. One of the best mexican dinners ever.  The corn tortillas and flour tortillas were fresh as can be. The salsa and chips fabulous and fresh. Everything was very fresh. Loved the guacamole. Could only eat a fraction of the huge portions of food. They also brought out a birthday fried ice cream topped with strawberries and whipped cream. And sang happy birthday. The Mariaches also came by and sang a couple songs for us. It was a delightful evening. This place looks like you stepped into Mexico City or Guadalajara.

The carnitas platter is excellent and so is the Lomo Azteca, which comes with a great chipotle sauce. The corn and flour tortillas are fresh and rival any competitor in town. There's a new tamale special every day, and they're usually pretty good. For lunch, I love the fish tacos--though I'd rather just go next door and order them from the fish counter.  The only thing that I thought was less than stellar was the chicken mole.

The sauce had zero taste.  Also, the complemented zucchini was flavored with a very exotic spice called salt (sarcasm).  Service was also so-so, with an upsell for shots every 10 minutes.

We ordered the Chili con Queso as an appetizer, for $8, it was a huge rip off. It was about 2 tablespoons of room temp melted cheese. My daughter's cheese nachos were 4 chips with melted white cheese that had NO flavor. My chili relleno had no flavor at all and about halfway through, had the flavor of cleaning product. I verified this with friend who was choking down his weird enchiladas (no other way to describe them).

Sakana has the wonderful Sakana lunch which is $10 comes with miso soup, small salad, a crunchy california roll thing, like 6 different nigiri pieces, and a spicy crab jalepeno popper thing. Yeah you read that right all of that for $10 at lunch time. I am a hungry dude and it's rare that i can finish all that food because there is so much. They also have a very good sashimi lunch special that is miso soup, 4 pieces of 4 different fishes, bowl of rice all for $11 and again very good. \n\nThe fish quality while not gonna make you mistake it for fresh catch or the best california or Seattle sushi joints is still fresh and tastes like it should and not like its been sitting for days or gonna be confused with the stuff sitting for hours on end at Fry's. I actually think it's pretty good and they do a good job at switching up what is in the lunch specials for what is in season and fresh so you do get good stuff and not just plain stuff as they mix in stuff like blue fin tuna or toro belly. I like the sashimi because usually it is Tuna, Salmon and 2 other fresh catches that rotate.\n\nAlso try the scallop dinamite as it is pretty good for cheap at lunch.\n\nLike i said though don't expect to be wowed as it won't happen but you want a good lunch for cheap this place is as solid as you can get."

When I'm looking for something a little more reserved and I want good sushi, I go to Sakana.\n\nThe portions are VERY generous, the atmosphere is quiet and cozy, the staff is happy and friendly and the focus is on good food, not a cool image. \n\nWhile it appears they don't have a \"happy hour\" at Sakana, they do have a special \"Customer Appreciation\" menu (Mon-Thur) with discounted prices on the most popular rolls. Plus, last night when we went, there was a special of \"order a Kirin or Kirin Light and get an appetizer for 50 cents.\" What a deal!\n\nAlso, this is a great place to go with a group because of the Teppanyaki Grill tables, and that is always a fun time!

I ordered the white plum white, but they only had enough to fill a little passed halfway, so they sold it to me half price; it tasted good.  Then I ordered Kirin beer (~$6 each).  You can get the sake bomb for a cheaper price too if you get it w/ the beer.  I didn't; my cousin did.  For each beer bought, we could buy an appetizer dish from the options listed.  We got the calamari, the dish w/ jalapeno and zucchini and batter I think I forgot the name, the spicy tuna roll, and shrimp tempura roll.  All of these were good.  Most of these were split among 3 people; we got full fast and walked out of there buzzed."

But in the end, the rest of the meal was just... meh.\n\nI'm a sucker for Spider rolls. But this one was over-powered by the addition of some odd crab meat mix. It wasn't bad, but it sure didn't have the flavor of soft-shell crab.\n\nMy wife had the Crunch Eel roll. It's a variation of something she gets as her standard order. Because the ingredients tend to be different from spot to spot, it's always fun to see each establishment's take on her favorite. In Sakana's case, they go much heavier on the batter, developing a product that's, well... hard. The \"eel sauce\" was heavier on the eel than the sugar. To me, that's a matter of taste. These guys want more eel, she wants it sweeter. That's OK. Just a mismatch in expectations.\n\nShe also had some unagi nigiri. Her comment: not very flavorful. But I chalk up at least some of this to the sauce, as that didn't resonate with her.\n\nBut as luck would have it, some friends have invited us _back_ tonight. They claim it's one of their favorite places. So maybe we just ordered wrong. At any rate, we'll try that again. Maybe the teppanyaki is better than the rolls, or that the sashimi will be sublime?"

(I love all things fried--their 50 cent appetizer menu is awesome for other fried food fanatics). The sushi tasted pretty good, but felt a bit soggy and fell apart. The teppanyaki steak was absolutely delicious, but the chef did not do any tricks or anything interesting. He just chopped up our food, cooked it, and calmly placed it on our plates. I'm used to flames and excitement when I go to a teppanyaki place. Their birthday song is pretty funny--a loud drum, a Japanese birthday song, ice cream, and a Good Fortune cat are enough to embarass almost anyone! All in all, decent food but mediocre service.

As a matter of a fact, I have been here 4 times for lunch in the past two weeks! Since I'm a bargain shopper I usually get the $10 lunch special which comes with a salad, miso soup, an assortment of nigiri, 2 stuffed jalapenos, and a California Roll. All of the lunch special is delicious you can even upgrade the regular Tuna for the Big-eye tuna for $1 more on special days. This place is so good I literally dream about eating here and I can't stop thinking about it until I go. The fish is so tender and fresh! This place is kind of small and Lunch is only served from 11am-2pm, so get there early if you want the special. One of these days I'll make it here for dinner to try the Teppanyaki, but right now I'm committed to lunch.   **This place does not have silverware on the table so if you despise chopsticks (like I do) you will have to shamefully ask for a fork or pretend like you know how to use chopsticks***"

But, that adds character! \n\nI had heard great things about the Sakana Lunch ($10). \n\nYou get miso soup, a small salad, six nigiri pieces, your typical crunchy-saucy California-esque roll and a crunchy crab jalape\u00f1o popper roll. \n\nDid I mention this was all for $10? So much food! Couldn't even finish mine. \n\nThe miso soup was meh, but really enjoyed the ginger dressing used on the salad. \n\nIs it the freshest sushi in the world? Definitely not. But you have to remember, this is Arizona.

He spent a great deal of the night explaining where the fish was sourced, when they get their fish in, the difference between quality vs quantity ect. Once I ordered Mackrel, he told me it was from Norway, asked what other kinds of fish I liked --- Then offered me two pieces of Tuna to taste (as comparison) completely GRATIS!\n\nAlso, and I have no idea how this even happened...I was thinking out loud \"I wonder if they have fresh wasabi?\"  I see the owner walking toward me, and before I have a chance to inquire, he puts out a small bowl in front of me \"Tada!\" ...fresh wasabi!\" HOW DID HE KNOW!?\n\nThe meal continues to be amazing. The fish is super fresh (he showed me a picture on his phone of the tuna he brought in that day) and the service spectacular. These folks WILL take care of you...and make sure you leave happy.\n\nOther points of note: It was someone's birthday at the table next to me, they brought out a drum and a sang a song for her, which I thought was cute. Also, the oranges after the meal, a wonderful touch. They're cut into small segments, placed back into the orange, and served with a little toothpick to pull out each piece.\n\nThe ONLY issue: The restaurant is small, and tables crammed. But again, when we sat down at a small two seater, I think I made a face because he took our menus, and said \"let me put you here...\" and gave us a larger spot.

Its like reading your car manual and discovering you have a sweet feature you haven't even been utilizing.  Then you abuse the fuck out of it.  \n\nI want to abuse the fuck out of the Sakana yellowtail, both in Nigiri and Maki form.  It is the freshest I've had anywhere, and (pardon the name dropping) but I've eaten at Koi in LA and Miko in Vancouver.  How they do it in a land-locked dustbowl is a mystery to me.  Whatever magic they use works, which they also must use to enlarge the rolls because they are a GREAT size.  Not too big so you can't get em in one bite, but almost.  For their size, the prices are VERY reasonable.\n\nGo here for your every-day-sushi and stop throwing it away at shi-shi celeb ventures like SeaSaw and Stingray (disclaimer: There is CERTAINLY a time for celebrity sushi, but IMO, not appropriate for everyday dine-out sushi)"

We awkwardly looked at each other for a few seconds, until I finally said, \"That's fine...can you put my name on the list?\" She actually responded, \"Oh, you want to wait?\", as if no one in their life ever waits for a meal at a restaurant. ...Darling, what is the purpose of the chairs in that little area in the front of the restaurant if not for waiting? I've never had a strong urge to eat my dinner there while people waltz in and out from dinner. She then asked us if we wanted to sit down immediately at a \"shared table\", which I thought might be something similar to the tables at Benihana - but no, it was literally a table we would have to share with two people already sitting having their dinner. Nothing says romantic date like 2 randos coming over with the hostess and sitting down to eat dinner with ya! We declined and waited however long it took, then went back to our own table.

It is through these people that I was introduced to Sakana.\nIf you are like I was, you might be carrying an unfair bias toward seafood prepared so far away from the sea.\nSakana is WONDERFUL and very reasonably priced!\nGet the Baked Scallops sushi. It is DELICIOUS!\nThe Mango Saketini's are very very good.\nThe age-dashi tofu is yummy.\n\nThis location of Sakana is especially good to party in. It really gets rollicking and is a little bit loud. If you are in the mood for a more elegant subdued experience, I suggest the other location of Sakana in Scottsdale. This place is a party and you might have to yell to your date."

I am a sushi connoisseur and in all of the places I've been and had sushi, NY, CA, IL, WA, FL, Mexico... nothing compares to the quality!  The price is very reasonable as well.  The only thing that is a tad disappointing is that the wait staff there seems to have a high turnover rate, I sometimes see a couple of the sushi chefs who I can remember from as far back as six years, but other than that, as much as my family and friends and I go there, we never get recognized as \"regulars\" because there's always someone new working there!  I'd say that's their only downfall.... Other than that, this would be by far my favorite place to eat in Arizona ;)"

The things I order are bastardized American versions of a long forgotten cuisine steeped in traditional intricacies and guided by the hand of custom.\n\nBut I don't mind.

I'm not sure the answer to that question but since I live in Tempe this place was the ace up my sleeve.\n\nWe didn't want to get too full but we wanted to eat.  I was hungry but cautious.  So we ordered accordingly.\n\n\"My wife will have the house martini and I'll just have water (ahem).  We'll have the Rainbow Roll, the Lobster Tempura Roll and the Gyoza appetizer.\"\n\nThe inside of Sakana is pretty dark at night and I like that aside from have to hold the menu closer to my face to read it.

Sakana is thou the worst offender of doing this. My husband and I went the other evening and ordered what we thought were 7 different rolls...nope-they all tasted the same. \nFake \"krab\" minced up and doused in mayo- minced tuna..again doused in mayo-and what didn't have mayo had cream cheese or was deep fried-ick. \n\nEven when asking the waitress what was in the rolls (we like to try different things) she at no time said \"krab salad\"-she just said crab...so when I get rolls that have this stick all minced up with mayo you can certainly understand my frustration. The head chef came over and apologized-however stated that it was their \"style\" and that's how most of the rolls are. \nDinner was atrocious and you leave here with your clothes reeking of oil due to the teppan bar that they have. So money wasted on something I could have done myself with a jar of Hellmans and a package of VandDeKamp Krab and additional money wasted on a dry cleaning bill. \nSave your palette and your money and go elsewhere if you are looking for good, clean, sushi.

BUT-how much longer could I have avoided such sushi cravings I've been having since I moved here? I need sushi in my life...\n\nAMBIANCE: \nIts interesting how sushi houses in Phoenix take orders by having a paper menu which the party can mark themselves. (Highly efficient btw.) \nLocated in a random shopping center, Sakana has a comfortable atmosphere with a little more real estate than you would figure this spot to be from the outside. Family & hip(ster-ish) oriented (patrons & servers alike) instead of the familiar K-pop cover ballads they played some 90's pop hits from MJ to Prince. Nothing like your 'HE HEEE'S!' & purple rain while you're scarfing down some good fish. Its casual.\n\nSUSHI & SERVICE: \nI went with a party of 5 on a Sunday with most of the tables occupied. Even so I was surprised we got our drinks & smoked salmon sashimi  within 5 minutes. We sampled 6 different rolls-from baked scallop to the tootsie roll to the fried Californian. All which I should say is pretty LEGIT. Not the straight out the water fresh but the THIS-IS-AS-GOOD-AS-IT-CAN-GET-SUSHI- WISE-OUT-HERE fresh. Which is all I can ask for! Really, it was DELICIOSO. \n-The rolls are your standard size for (Americanized) sushi about 4-6 pieces.\n-If you ever order the baked scallop roll they bless it with an abundance of crab meat/chopped up scallops & topped off with sprinkled fish eggs-no room for dissapointment here. \n\nThough Sakana has 2 other locations in the valley it does not have the flavor of 'chain' sushi. Also they mixed up an order of a massive sushi plater & placed it on our table then had to quickly take it back right when my cousin was about to pinch one with her chopsticks. Well 2 minutes later we were served a plate of another Vegas roll-on the house. To compensate for the possible emotional distress you may have caused taking away  that triple roll platter-compensate you did. NOTED.\n\nBRAVO Sakana for your timely & friendly service, being open on sunday & the complimentary sushi. I shall return to this sushi house in the desert! Finally a place for my sushi fix."

Probably the very same week.  \n\nWell... that was a mistake.  I sat at the same bar.  Ordered the same food.  The sushi chef was different though. Every piece of Nigiri I ate made me tear up.  I'm not always a complainer (vocally) so I didn't say anything and just assumed the chef was new and learning the ropes.  Well, the next day my stomach told me otherwise. I now realize the chef was hiding bad fish with massive amounts of wasabi. \n\nI never went back, nor will I.  Also, I eat a ton of sushi.  I'm surprised I don't have mercury poisoning.

Somehow though Phoenix remains without a great Teppan restaurant.\n\nMy nephew is an Asian food junkie and loves Teppan, so for his birthday we really wanted to give him a great experience and Sakana remained one of two places in town we have not tried so onward...\n\nWe were sat immediately about 15 minutes prior to our reservation and quickly ordered drinks and sushi.  After reading other reviews I walked over to the sushi bar and looked at the day's specials.  We ordered two types of Nigiri off the special board and then Uni and Spicy Scallops.  For my nephew we got a spicy tuna roll.  There was nothing wrong with any of it.  The sushi had a clean taste and was very good.  It was a pleasant surprise.\n\nThe teppan started with a decent soup and salad.  The show itself was good, not great.  The portions of the meats were astonishing, absolutely huge.  Same with the veggies.  The rice was good and came in the standard cup.  A little odd was that the rice and veggies were an add on for an additional $3.  Not a big deal but just different.  Overall all the meats and the shrimp were okay.  I took a piece of my husband's steak as Teppan steak I always feel has the best flavor for steak from my perspective as a non steak eater, and it tasted like typical steak.\n\nSo basically the whole food experience was a standard.  Nothing really standing out, nothing bad.  On the other side was the service.  Lackadaisical is the word that comes to mind.    My sister said she felt she bussed our table.  Since our party of 4 was alone at the teppan table we kept passing her our dishes to put on the other end as not one thing was removed from the table.  Think about the number of items I mentioned having and how many dishes that means!  I had to ask to get water and tea refills and my glasses were removed and returned in the most bizarre way.  A pitcher could have been so much simpler.  It took a good 15 minutes for my sister's beverage to come from the bar.  It was almost an hour before the teppan chef came over.  \n\nThe server though was personable enough that the non-service service was less irritating than it might have been in other circumstances.  I doubt I will be back, but it wasn't a bad experience and for someone in the Ahwatukee area i would say if they have time and don't have a ton of money to spend on Teppan or sushi it is not  a bad choice."

Don't get me wrong, there is nothing wrong with the fish here. I like this place. It is a good value for your money. The atmosphere is laid back and a good place to hang out with friends. The service is OK, but it lacks the ambience that the staff at the Gilbert location give. But, like I said I still like this location and will visit it often."

Once we got the attention of a server, we placed our order for the lunch special rolls. Even though this place was very busy (~12:30pm with lots of business lunch patrons), you could watch as some servers stood around not doing anything. Rolls came out at a reasonable pace but we weren't even given a small plate to eat each piece off of and had to eat over our roll plates. We were only checked on once (not by our original server) and that was because she was resting her elbow on the booth section divider and casually asked us if everything was good. When we were done eating we waited for at least 5 minutes to see if they would bring a check, then we started making eye contact with servers hoping they would get the point but they would continue with whatever they were doing. We had to flag someone down to get our check. Unacceptable level of service from start to finish.\n\nFood: You could tell how they could offer such good deals on their lunch special rolls when they overload the rolls with rice and fake crab/mayo (I have no problem with either ingredient, but they pack the rolls with it to the point where many different rolls tasted very similar because they were so dominant with the fake crab mix). Each piece was extremely large and cumbersome to eat, often falling apart before you can find a way to fit it in your mouth. The rolls weren't even in the shape of a circle, but more like a rounded triangle. The sushi chefs were either rushed, new, or incompetent. I'm also suspicious that the spicy tuna uses canned tuna as filler along with chunks of real tuna. I'll let you decide if that's acceptable for sushi.\n\nAmbiance: It's ok. You won't pay attention to it when you're trying to get a servers attention."

Worst of all, the sushi was bizarre. I ordered an Alaskan roll and spicy tuna and the Alaskan came out as a gigantic roll with piles of salmon and mayo-filled fake crab salad and no avocado. I appreciate the value I guess? but having the huge roll with that in it was inedible and I have never not finished a sushi roll. The spicy tuna had tons of mayo-y spicy tuna and then more fake crab mush. Our tofu tempura appetizer came out after the entrees. The music was also strange- loud 90s music.

Everyone was really friendly and the wait staff was very knowledgeable about the items on the menu.\n\nAs far as the food goes, it was excellent.

The meat is extremely tender and ample, like having a steak except incredibly nutritious. The fish is served with a sweet sauce which is delicious and when eaten with Kirin Light it creates a perfect pair, just ask for it you will not be disappointed. Rolls are excellent as well, some of my favorites would be the Cajun wild fish roll or the crunchy eel roll. The sashimi is always made fresh and promptly, the shrimp, salmon and eel are some of the tasty items I enjoy.\n\nThe Bartender Wes keeps everyone quenched and always has positive energy.

I have revisited Sakana on a business trip and now I am wondering if this is the same Sakana that I used to frequent...\nTo start with, the kind of sushi is certainly not the traditional sushi that you usually see in real Japanese restaurants. Real traditional Japanese restaurants offer smaller, well-cut and well-wrapped pieces \nwith a small amount of rice and high quality fish meat.  If I remember correctly the sushi in Sakana used to be like that 4-5 years ago.  \nNow the current Sakana offers huge slices of fish meat and huge amount of fish eggs but they may easily fall apart.   The quality and freshness are also mediocre at best, or to be more exact, close to the quality you find in all you can eat restaurants like Todai, Minado...,etc.\nThe rainbow roll that used to wow me is still the same price...but I am not sure if it is the same quality. The interior is certainly getting old and the carpet is really worn out.  All of which make it less and less attractive.  The best dish I had was the clam miso soup, but the sushi was really disappointing.  If you want \"volume\" at a more affordable price, I would recommend Todai or even Pacific. If you want \"real\" traditional Japanese sushi at an affordable price, I recommend Hiro Sushi in Scottsdale.  If you have a good amount of money to spend, you might as well spend it at Sushi On Shea, though you are really paying more for the atmosphere... I am sad to say that I would  not come back to Sakana again...This is definitely not the Sakana in my memory."

Enough time to drive over, stop at the Safeway and get some beer before picking up the delicious yumminess.  Did that, got the sushi, paid and was halfway home when it occurred to me that there were fewer boxes than usual.  Pulled over, did a check and... sure enough, they forgot my nigiri.  Darn.\n\nCalled them up, told them what happened, and headed over to pick up my food.  (I had been charged for it, I was going to get it.)  Head to the hostess, tell her who I am, \"Oh, ok.  We'll put that order in for you.\" Uh? You didn't already? \"You're going to expedite it, right?\" \"Oh, of course.\"\n\nSo I wait.  And wait.  And wait.  How long does it take to make up 8 rice balls, wasabi them and plop pre-cut fish?! Talk to the hostess... it is coming? My other sushi IS sitting in the car.  \"I'll go check.\"  Ok... so I wait some more.  I've been irritated for a while now, but apparently it is becoming visible.  It has been 30(!!) minutes since my \"expedited\" order was put in (70 minutes since my original order was phoned in).  The manager sees this and comes over, asking what is wrong.  I tell him.  To his credit, he gets the order handled and gives me a $10 coupon to come back.  Still annoyed, but mollified, I head out.\n\nFast forward to last night.  I have my coupon and a hankerin' for sushi, so wrassle up the boy and head back to give Sakana another chance.  I put our name on the list (30 minute wait) and, because it is crowded & noisy, head outside to wait.  There are several other folks out there and, periodically, the hostess comes out calling names.  Once. Twice.  Three times.  She comes out, calling names.  \n\nAfter a while, someone comes out and lights up a cigarette within smelling range (ew!!!), so the boy and I head inside to wait.  Names are called.  New people come in and get their names on the list.  More people are seated.  It can't be long now! Then the hostess goes out and fetches some of the new people, happily taking them to a table.  \n\nWTF?! The boy goes and looks at the list.  We've been crossed off.  WTFF?! Our name hadn't been called - we were in earshot the entire time; why was it crossed off? Forget this - I guess they don't want us to eat here.  So we got up and went across town to my true favorite sushi place.  (If it weren't such a long drive to Scottsdale, we'd always go there.)  Which worked out much better, since the staff recognize us, the fish is better, there is more non-sushi variety for the boy, and it is much less noisy and crowded.\n\nI'll be back to Sakana one more time.  I still have that coupon after all and $10 of sushi is $10 of sushi.  But now I'm on the prowl for a new sushi place close by to become my new \"take out\" place.  It's too bad... I DO like them a lot, but to receive execrable service two times in a row is unacceptable."

I grew up in Monterey Bay & was often able to enjoy sushi grade seafood right off the boat courtesy of my fishing family.  Sakana has impressed me since I moved to Phoenix in 1999. They always have impressively fresh fish. I highly recommend ordering from their specials board because it is usually the freshest & best quality fish being offered. Oh, and did I mention the portion sizes are ginormous compared to higher priced, lower quality Phoenix sushi joints?  Well, they are!  Also, don't be afraid to ask what the sushi chefs recommend, they've never steered me wrong.\n\nFor my 27th (again) birthday, my friends & family joined me for dinner at their teppanyaki tables. We got dinner & a show! Ramon, who takes great care of us at the sushi bar, was cooking that night and got all my guests into the action. Food was very good, but the ambiance made it excellent.\n\nJun, a manager, was also very accomodating when I invited my vegan friend to try sushi for the first time. Eee gads you say?!? Not so, Jun was able to have a batch of rice made without the benito flake seasoning, ordered us some fantastic veggie rolls using it, and added a great veggie tempura sans animal product.\n\nMy bottom line is this, if you want good quality sushi and excellent service & attention, then Sakana on Elliot is the place to go. Just leave two seats at the sushi bar open for my husband & me!!"

Every time I've gone, the servers completely ignore us.  During the first time, it took about 10 minutes to get a menu.  Maybe another 15 to get a simple gin & tonic.  When the server finally decided to come back around to see if we wanted to eat (we'd been looking for her for a while) we ordered a small amount of food.  20 minutes later a new server delivers the food (which was warm and awful).  We sat around for about 15 more minutes waiting for our checks (which were delivered by yet another new person).  They finally take our money and also take their sweet time bringing back the change.  I will openly admit that I did not tip.   I forgot to mention that this was at night.  It was a little busy, but eventually completely died.  After the crowd disappeared, we still got completely ignored.\n\nThe second time I decided to give it a chance, we went for lunch.  The service was a bit better.  I could only assume that the other person helping our server was the manager.  He flat-out lied to my face, which upset me very much.  I asked for a gin & tonic again.  The server goes to put that drink order in and the manager comes up to me saying their out of both gin and tonic.  I ordered a vodka cranberry instead.  It was awful.  Probably no vodka in it.  My friend pointed to the shelves of liquor where there stood in plain sight a bottle of Tanqueray and a bottle of Bombay.  Thanks manager for being such an asshole.  Once again the food came out at a warm temperature.  It was very hard to keep down.  \n\nAfter the 2nd trip, I've decided not to come back.  It's awful service, management, and mediocre food.  I highly advise that the owner or GM takes a good look at his staff and the way things are being ran.  It's a bad restaurant in every way."

He is always happy to chat with patrons, and share a cheer or two with a glass of beer.\nThe ambiance changes every day.\nFriday's are usually the busiest, with mostly families and birthday go-ers. Saturday's are more or less like the previous, and Sundays are amazing with their customer appreciation specials!\nEvery time I have gone, they have always have had New Rolls, Specials, and different types of Sushi to try.\nTheir Rolls are absolutely delicious, and quite large.\nFor the prices, this place is worth it.\nI am quite smitten with Salmon in particular, as well as Eel, so I usually order their Alaska Roll, and Unagi. Quail eggs are adventurous, and I am excited that they have added Tokyo Style Ramen to their menu! You have to try this- It was ridiculously delicious and satisfying- not to mention their Lobster Miso as well.\nThis place is my Sushi Spot.

The site where it was listed offered no reviews or information besides a few pictures and location. I decided, being the risk taker that I am, to give it a whirl. We arrived at a little hole-in-the-wall place tucked into a small strip mall. Outside we found a packed parking lot and a line at the door... on a tuesday.\n  Sakana was just opening for dinner service and despite the tuesday dinner rush(still makes me chuckle) we were seated swiftly and with choice as to where we sat. Once nestled comfortably at the sushi bar we were greeted by Ramon, not my idea of a sushi chef, but boy was i wrong. \n  Itamae doesnt quite describe the skill level Ramon was on, he was masterful, and strangely I was not put off by him at all when he engaged me in conversation(I am not a public people person). Ramon you are great at what you do!\n  Now we are at the most important part of the journey, the food, which was delicious. We ordered sever different types of sushi: Eel, Blue Fin, Egg and Octopus. Lets start with the bad first, Octopus... I personally hate it, always chewy, tough and so citrusy i cant bear it. So thats the bad, now for the good. Blue Fin melted in your mouth with the consistency of firm butter and was excellent. The Egg was great aswell, sweet with a back end of head dizzying sake(not over bearing but noticable if you dont drink.)\n  Now for my favorite part of the meal, Eel, saying that I am an eel lover is an understatment, I dream of good eel, all I can say is that I was impressed and thats the highest compliment I could ever give to eel because I've never had bad eel. Also had a crunchy eel roll that was superb.\n  My wife ordered Calimari and Ramen both of which were delicous aswell, the sauce for the calimari was my favorite part of the plate. As for the ramen, if you want good authentic ramen with a smell that will cause people to come up to you and ask you what that is that you ordered, look no further.\n  All that for under $40 WHAT?! ive paid over a hundred for far worse!\n  After years of searching I have finally found my sushi destination. Thank you Ramon for the many wonderful times you have provided us with we will be back soon!\n\nP.S. I have never left that place with out atleast one thing gratis(fish ribs were great but im too lazy to eat them...)"

No weird, funny faces today!\n\nWhat we ordered...\n\nSalty Fish Fried Rice - Do NOT order this unless you know what you're getting into... This Fried Rice is made with salted preserved dried fish, cut up into little pieces, also cooked with pieces of chicken. Most non-Orientals would exclaim who's got BO! I've just warned you! My friend had not had this dish in years... loved it.\n\nPan Fried Shrimp - Whole Shrimp is fried WITH the skin... You will see the shrimp staring right back at you with it's beady black eyeballs! How to eat - Break off shrimp at neck and eat the body and tail... Even the skin is edible! Chomp on the shrimp's head at your own risk! The shrimp is served with thin slices of Jalapeno on a bed of lettuce. The Jalapeno gives it a nice hot flavor!\n\nSzechuan Green Beans - This turned out to be sweeter than Wong's usually makes it. Think it was contaminated from another table's order... But still VERY GOOD!\n\nBlack Pepper Sizzling with Black Bean Sauce - Black Bean Sauce is used in Chinese dishes as a salt alternative.

The meat is cut strange, little triangle on the bone, and the flavor is sooo different than Korean BBQ, it's almost insulting. also, just an OK dish), and pan fried noodles (seemed like thinner noodles, the chow mein noodles were weak).  \n\nI don't doubt that this is the best Chinese in Phoenix (friends at the cooking school in town atest to this fact), however, there is so much more out there in the US.\n\nService was good, place was clean.

        "review": "Wong's Place is my favorite little family-owned neighborhood Chinese restaurant.  It has the quaint charm that is typical of a hole-in-the-wall Asian dining establishment, complete with the pastel decor reminiscent of the 80's.  The staff is the same loyal, polite staff that has been serving there for years and the service is consistently impeccable.  The staff always greets us with a familiar smile, the food is always delicious, my glass is always full, and the prices are very modest.  Although I have had many of their entrees, a few come to mind as the standalone, \"must have\" dishes to recommend above all others.  The Seafood Hot & Sour Soup is by far the most delectable option on the menu!  It is far different than the standard hot & sour fare and is filled with mussels, shrimp & squid, green onions and mushrooms in a spicy red broth.....it makes my mouth water with delight when I think of it!  Everyone that tries it keeps coming back for it, no matter how far the drive!  A few other faves are the Wong Jo Chicken with black mushrooms and ginger and the Pork Fried Rice.  If you have a large party to entertain, Wong's offers a special dinner price that is all inclusive and large family-style tables so that  everyone can share.  It is not uncommon for the place to be packed with families at dinner time on the weekends.  If it is fine dining or gourmet Chinese ambiance that you are looking for, you won't find it here, BUT....I highly recommend Wong's if you are looking for a delicious neighborhood fare for a great price."

I'm not going to recommend any one dish but Wong's is the closest thing I've experienced to Chinese food in the Northeast (think Seinfeld minus the deliveries). Prices are reasonable and there are even two different menus, one being an authentic Chinese one. I had a server who completely didn't understand me, which is why I left off a fifth star. He wasn't Chinese either. There is no decor in this place whatsoever so you know the main focus is the food. It even feels like a NY sit down Chinese restaurant. From what I'm told it's been around a while too, well worth checking out."

Wongs was on par with some of the best SF Chinese restaurants 6-7 years ago.  However, it has gotten cheap.  The restaurant is often dirty with bugs and flies. The tables are dirty. The food is too oily now.  The preparation seems to have taken a hit as well.  We ordered a vegetarian item and they cooked it in fish sauce so the whole item smelled and tasted of fish. That's just laziness on their part as they obviously recycled oil.  I will consider getting take-out but the food has gone down hill. \n\nThere are better restaurants in the valley now: 1. Gourmet House of Hong Kong 2. Big Wong and 3. China Chile ...all in downtown are better"

Ignorance is bliss and when there's no competition, they can do this kind of stuff.\n\nThankfully, there about 10 chinese restaurants within a 5 mile radius of this place and no one I know even comes near this place.\n\nSo if it's high prices and diet-sized portions you're looking for, then have at it.\n\nWhat cracks me up is that the top 5 restaurants (according to many of the local chinese) are either not even on yelp or have only a few reviews.\n\nThe best \"yelpers\" are the word-of-mouthers.  if it's good it spreads throughout the chinese community like wild fire.

Having not had Chinese food in a while (in a state that lacks any real great Chinese food), we decided to give Wong's Place a shot.  We ordered the twice-cooked pork and the beef chow fun in black bean sauce.  Neither of the dishes were really that great.  The twice-cooked pork was far too sweet and overloaded with vegetables as filler and the beef chow fun was greasier than I'd prefer.\n\nAnd to seal the deal, a classmate of mine whom I saw working there, later informed me to avoid eating here because they allegedly \"recycle\" the rice there.  You got it, the last table's leftover white rice is now being added into your pot and served to you.\n\nIf you're looking for legit Chinese food, you're better off going somewhere else.\n\nEdit: Based on recent reviews, perhaps the 1-2 star reviews aren't getting their point across.  Here's a list of places you're better off going to:\n\n1. Asian Hong Kong/Hong Kong Asian Diner (the name escapes me, but it's on the NW corner of Rural and Ray)\n2. Panda Express\n3. Subway\n4. Filibertos\n\nAs you can see, while there are more legitimate (and delcious) Chinese restaurants to eat at, it seems that just about ANYWHERE is a better choice than Wong's.

Tea to talk over is fabulous when you're waiting for your meal to be prepared. The pot stickers are my favorite- the meat is well seasoned and the dumpling flour is perfectly chewy. Their won-ton soup is possibly the best in town! I recently tried their Lobster Sauce Shrimp (comes with white rice), and it was amazing.

My only complaint is that sometimes the place can be a bit... seedy looking.  It doesn't help having a dive bar next door.  The inside looks the same as it did when I first ventured in there in the early (mid?) 90s.  NOTHING has changed... probably the same silverware and cups.

Deep fried chicken breast with orange peel sauce & water chestnuts, intense delightful flavor with just the right amount of kick, very similar to General Tso's chicken.  I ordered Szechuan Egg Plant with pork, the great flavor of perfectly cooked eggplant with tons of pork in a delicate but spicy sauce.

Having lived on the East Coast a few years, I miss the little Chinese restaurants - tiny little places, nothing fancy, inexpensive, that serve up good sized portions of Chinese food.  I have no idea what authentic is.  What I do know, is what tastes good.\n\nI've lived half a mile (at most) from this place for a few years and have always wanted to try it.  Wife isn't a fan of Chinese food, so I just never got around to it.  Finally tried it last weekend and was very happy.\n\nVery nondescript looking place, nothing special on the inside, though it did appear clean (at least from the front where I was standing).  The guy who took my order (and who I assume also served me when I went to pick up) was very nice.  \n\nI had the Kung Pao chicken, which to me seems like a very generic meal - something that is a good measuring stick on which to judge Chinese restaurants (like ordering Pad Thai at a Thai restaurant...I always try that first).  \n\nThe egg drop soup was quite nice as well -- pretty thick, but very simple, very tasty.\n\nI should be clear - it's nothing fancy.  It's not out of this world amazing.  It is good.  It is inexpensive.  It is a pretty decent portion size.  It was *exactly* what I wanted.  \n\nI'll be back...next step is to convince the wife to try something from here."

When I'm missing my mom's cooking, I always end up here.  I'll even ask them to concoct something up when I'm in a daring mood and it's always good.\n\nMy favorite dishes are: \nPan Fried Shrimp - If anyone in your party is squeamish, this is a warning.. it's cooked whole with the eyes!\nSeafood Chow Fun - wide rice noodles with shrimp, scallops and squid. You won't find this at Panda Express!\nSalty Fish Fried Rice - Preserved salted dried fish and chicken stir fried in rice. This is not your standard fried rice and it has a very strong fish taste/smell. Only the brave should try this!\nSzechaun Green Beans - Pork and green beans. A little on the spicy side. This is no longer on the menu, but if you ask for it, they'll prepare it and you'll love it! \n\nI always want to try another dish, but I love the dishes that I've had and it's so hard to decide what to order once I get there. \n\nThey serve an excellent dessert that's included with your meal... very refreshing.\n\nI have been coming here for 15+ years.

I have had only a few issues with the rice for the sizzling rice soup being overcooked but I will say that the soup is awesome and tastes awesome (Three flavor). Wong-Jo chicken is good with egg fried rice, egg foo yung, house deluxe chow mein, imprerial three delights, mongolian beef (not a huge portion, but tasty), and random other tastyness!! \n\nThey have not updated the decor and everytime that I come in to get my order, I converse with the guy that always takes my order. He is not The Mr. Wong, but he is like his right hand man. He recently told me that they have not fired any of their workers because everyone has been working there for over 10 years. Even in this economy when business is OK at best, they take care of their people. \nI hope this place never closes down or I will be sad for them, and hard pressed to find anyone who can mirror the sizzling rice soup and wong-jo chicken. \n\nIt is a typical chinese restaurant but I think the food is better than most chinese knock-off restaurants. I think that if you can enjoy the authentic atmosphere and the food (pink menu if you are scared of authentic chinese), then you should be satisfied with your meal.

Chinese food is better there from my experience, but the greater Phoenix area isn't known for being a foodie mecca like SF or NY.\n\nNone the less, it's a good meal and is on our list of staple go-out places.\n\nThe things I generally get there are the beef with oyster sauce, moo shu chicken or mongolian beef.  My boyfriend likes a variety of other things - but we both love the sizzling rice soup.  Its awesome.\n\nUltimately, Chinese is a pretty subjective food more so than alot of other cuisine.  Everyone has a specific taste set for it in their palates it seems, so give it a try for yourself."

My Taiwanese pals took me here and I've been eating here once a week ever since.  The service is great and the food is out of this world!  My favorites are the Mongolian beef and the Beef with snow peas, but I've tried many of their other dishes and all of them were just as good.  Don't know what you want?  Tell the waiter what you like...type of meat, spicy or sweet, etc...and he'll come back with a dish so satisfying, you'll think the chef read your mind!  I LOVE this place!  It's fairly quiet on weekday nights but weekend nights are busier."

Mine arrived first Beef and Chinese broccoli looked great. I took my first bite and looked up at my son and saw a large COCKROACH run behind him on the both I quietly told him to get up and I tried to kill it. I then motioned for the waiter as he was bringing out the rest of our orders and informed him of the nasty little bug and he said sorry we sprayed last week and walked away. Within seconds two more one on the table and one on the booth next to my son I grabbed my napkin and killed the one on the table got up and took it to the Owner Manager? and informed him my family and I would not be eating at his restaurant and he needed to take care of this obvious pest issue he quickly took the napkin with the ROACH from me and said ok thank you.

I go to Wong's place every chance I get which is not often enough as I am traveling most of the time and eating out at restaurants all over the country.  I wish there was a place like this everywhere I travel.  \n\nI give this place 5 stars because of the price compared to the quality of food, casual atmosphere, and mostly because of the awesome service.  If I didn't go into this place for 6 months and walk in, the waiters remember what I have ordered in the past and they go the extra mile to have me try meals that I might like. This place is so casual that anyone should have no reservation about telling them if you ordered something you didn't like or have a problem with anything.  These folks are that awesome. You would be hard pressed to find such a nice place or people.   Even the \"Duke of A Mountain\"  and his family eat here often and these folks could eat anywhere they desire. \n\nThanks Mr. Wong and Staff,   We love your place as do many others.\n\nGuy & Friends"

I suggest that TEG either use smaller-sized bread, or up the filling a bit!  The cost of the sandwich is definitely too high-- I wouldn't order this same sandwich for that price again (especially when I could order a huge serving that is equally as tasty, perhaps more so, at Phoenix Ranch Market-- the telera bread there is amazing!).  Indeed, I had to order two side tacos for their meat contents (pastor y carne asada) to be able to fill in the rest of the torta :(  Based on what I tried, if I were to come back, I'd order the pastor.

Its really overwhelming!\n\nThe Mr and I like to take weeknight foodie plunges. Generally on weeknights I'm slaving over a hot wok, comal or grill while the Mr 'works' late, just managing to show up just in time to eat (life seems so unfair doesn't it?)! So when he got home last night and didn't see dinner ready he knew it was plunge night. \n\nWe both knew it had to be some sort of sandwich. We've been wanting to try a new place not to far from home called Andreoli's but for some reason I thought they close early. So then I was up to bat.. torta's! Oh yeah and I saw a write up in the New Times last week for a place on 16th Street. So we piled into the Honda and headed west.\n\nThis place is only a few blocks south of the famed Bario Cafe. Inside the place has been updated with tin roof walls and a clean open appearance. Inside oddly enough was a very attractive blond woman (think Uma Thurman) cleaning off the tables. She was the nicest person I had met in some time! She walked us through the menu answering our questions and making many suggestions. We finally ordered 2 torta's and a quesadilla (a gurl has got to eat!)! She then invited us to their salsa bar.. 3 different salsas, pickled carrots/jalapeno and freshly sliced cucumbers. Oh, beware.. the salsa's are on the spicy side and may cause pooper fire syndrome! \n\nThe tray arrived with our mexiches and quesadilla.. the Mr bit into his Pastor (4.99) and his eyes widened as if to attempt to make his mouth bigger by intimidation. Large cubes of pork simmered in a spicy red sauce inside of nice thick bun that had been lightly toasted. On to my Cubana (5.90).. This bad boy is also on a toasted bun though inside.. ham, roast pork, milaneza, cheese, lettuce and mayo. Whew, it was good good good. \n\nAs we were noshing through the torta's the quesadilla caught my eye. It looked so lonely sitting there with melted cheese oozing from the edges.. so seductive, enticing.. fresh. I had to take a bite!  Yeah babe, you're so good. The Alambre (4.99) is filled with onions, cheese, beef and pork slices on a very large flour tortilla.. this alone was worth the drive! The texture of the onions and cheese against the tender meats and crispy tortilla was just delish! This paired nicely with the Horchata (1.99)..  silky smooth and not overly sweet.\n\nI guarantee next week when the Mr gets home and the kitchen is dark and empty he will know it his turn to buy dinner!"

None of the servings were generous.  We must remember, expenses are skyrocketing at the production level so we'll get less food or higher prices.  Flavor, texture and sauce of my burrito mild and decent.  Ratings 3 - 3.5.  We also drank horchata, jamaica and ice tea.

It really does feel like you're visiting your innocent grandparents who live in a not so hot neighborhood.\n\nNow onto the food that can't help but soak up all of that love that surrounds it.\n\nToday, I ordered the Torta Al Pastor. If you aren't familiar with Al Pastor style meat, which is most commonly associated with pork, you need to do a little research, because you are in for a real treat! I would consider Al Pastor style to be the Mexican version of what Rednecks call BBQ Style. This torta would be the Mexican equivalent to a pulled pork sandwich.\n\nFrom the warm, lightly toasted bread that is classically used with Tortas, to the light mayo, the Avocado, shredded lettuce, thin pickled green Chile's, thin sliced tomato, marinated pork in the Al Pastor seasonings, the love is in every bite of this beauty. \n\nI'm not big on bread, and sub sandwiches just have way too much bread that take away from the flavor of the quality parts of the sub sometimes. The Mexicans really outdid us with the Torta. When a torta is made fresh and properly by an experienced set of Mexican old timers who love to see people smile when they eat their food, it's something that will put any hot sub in town to shame!\n\nIf you aren't a fan of swine, don't be alarmed, there are many other selections, and yes the do have a Torta Carne Asada for the unadventurous Weditos.. ;)\n\nDon't be such a Wedito and go try something different, I can assure you that regardless of the torta at this location, you will not be dissatisfied, and I promise that you will feel like you are eating at your Mexican Grandparents place...\n\nWhile you are in this place, help them unlock their business on Yelp. They are like most other grandparents and technology has run right past them.\n\nThis place could use some business, and I know that others out there who are like myself, always love to know of random little places that may not look so hot from the street, but are a real treat once you break through those doors.\n\nCan't wait to start seeing some more reviews on this place, it deserves some Yelp attention!\n\nCheers and Salute! ;)"

        "review": "The name says it all.  This family owned restaurant (3 to be exact) specializes in tortas but they also carry your staple Mexican fast-food affair you would find in AZ.  Everything I or anyone else has had has been solid.  Just in case you don't know what a torta is, the best way I can explain what one is that it is essentially a toasted sandwich with a fusion of Mexican and American ingredients.  When it comes to TEG's tortas, there are a few standouts.  One would be the cochinita.\n\nCochinita which is marinated pork is absolutely delicious by itself, but in a torta, it is absolutely scrumptious!!!  My best description of what cochinita is to think of pulled pork that is braised in a slightly sweet, salty, and spicy redish/orangeish sauce.  In addition, it has American sandwich staples such as mayo, shredded lettuce.  What makes it a \"torta\" are the slices of sweet and sour pickled jalapenos and carrots and slices of avocado (and they do not skimp).  What completes the sandwich, I mean torta, is the bread.  It's always warm and fluffy in the inside and the outside always has a nice crisp texture from the grill.\n \nThe other torta I would strongly recommend is the carne asada.  The combination of the carne asada steak with mayo, fresh pico de gallo, and lettuce along with the warm bread makes this torta an absolute winner (my mouth is actually watering just thinking about it!).\n\nThe Cubana, which has your typical ingredients that come with any spin on the classic Cuban, is also good.  If you are a big fan of Cubans, then this one may be for you. But in my humble opinion, this does not anywhere near come close to the yummy goodness of the cochinita and carne asada.\n\nThe Hawiiana (Hawaiian) is also a relative good choice.  With the combination of Ham and fresh grilled pineapple along with other condiments, it also is descent selection.\n\nAs I stated before, they do have staple Arizona style Mexican fast-food here and there are a few I would recommend.  One would be the flautas (large deep fried rolled tacos).\n\nThe pollo is the one I would suggest.  If you envision your typical fried rolled tacos with guacamole and cheese, well this is not that, this is even better!  The flautas at TEG are larger with much more stuffing then your typical rolled tacos.  In addition, they make them with yummy flour tortillas, not your typical corn.  The shredded chicken is well seasoned and moist.  The tortilla is always fried perfectly, light crisp on the outside with the inside of the tortilla still soft.\n\nThe burritos here are good, actually better than average, but because the tortas here are the showcase, everything else takes a backseat.  The rice and beans are hit and miss, especially at the Chandler location.\n\nI used to give TEG four and a half stars, but with the mistake of expanding too quickly, combined with quality and consistency falling a bit, I would have to give them three and half stars; four stars would be stretching. I'm anal so three and three quarter seems to fit.\n\nFor example, the Phoenix location, which the Son runs and where he started the chain has a few issues.  For example, the Cochinita at the Phoenix location is always drier and saltier than the other two locations.  In addition, they have certain items only at that location that the other two do not.  One would be their Sonoran style hotdogs, which are excellent and an item I would highly recommend.  When I have gone to both the Mesa and Chandler location and asked for them, and unfortunately they said they don't carry them.  I was disappointed to say the least. \n\nAnother example of inconsistency is the last time I went to the Chandler location.  I brought a couple of out of town guests, and I was a little disappointed because the bread was a little too bready (dense) and not light and fluffy as usual.  When all the ingredients are in perfect symphony, you have one amazing torta, but when one ingredient is off such as something like the bread being too dense throws off that harmonious balance of flavors and textures.  In this case, it made a difference from a four and half star sandwich to a 3 star sandwich (which is still good in my book, but not great).\n\nThe best and most consistent is their Mesa location.  I think that it is because Mom and Pops run that particular location (well they used to anyways).  Everything has always been consistently delici-oh-so-good.\n\nOverall, would I still recommend Tortas El Guero, and do I still go?  Yes, but I wouldn't rave about the place like I once did especially with the inconsistencies I've experienced as of late."

Gustavo (the owner) & his lovely wife and their 2 cute kids are the beginning of this great experience.  EVERYTHING here is good and a whole lot cheaper than many bona fide Mexican places.  My favorite is the Pollo Ahogado, aka Drowned Chicken Torta.  It has avocado,just a few jalapenos (and is the only way I've ever been able to eat those), and the most amazing red sauce. I ask for the salsa INSIDE the sandwich just to be sure.  You will need 15-20 napkins and may not be able to conquer the whole thing if you're a chica like me.  By the way.....if you go in here twice, you get treated like a friend. They are awesome.  Oh! And the \"Boing\" juices are from one of the only union-run beverage cooperatives in Mexico.  :)  They 're good, too."

We arrived shortly after 12p and the place was not empty, but far from full.  Pretty quiet actually, which I was surprised as the tortas had been very highly recommended.\n\nThe layout is nothing fancy, doesn't look like much from the outside, or the inside.  The service is very friendly and very helpful.  The guy who helped us made some great recommendations.\n\nFirst off, the tortas are great.  The bread is made special for them (think it's a bolillo roll, or something like that).  But they taste fresh and go perfectly with the tortas.  \n\nWe had the milanesa de res, which is basically a breaded carne - it was fantastic - the torta comes with the meat of your choice, some jalepenos, lettuce and a couple small slices of avocado.  So simple, so delicious.  \n\nWe also tried the Cochinita torta, which was tasty, but not quite as over the top delicious as the other.  \n\nThey have a choice of a couple sauces at a little salsa bar - the red chile sauce is mediocre, the spicy chile verde was surprisingly spicy and exceptionally tasty.  I got so excited by a sample that I piled it onto my torta and ended up sweating through the rest of it!  It is sneaky spicy!\n\nThe horchata was great, if not overly memorable.  \n\nI'll definitely be back."

I don't know exactly what the criteria is to get the Sushi Sensei badge but I'm just about ready to give up, at least going to new places around here.  Seriously, it has been a huge disappointment.\n\nOkay, this place ... don't bother with getting the curry.  You know those curry packages you get at the store to make your own curry?  Yup, tastes like that.  It's fine and all but charging me $9 and putting on the plate 2 potatoes and 2 carrots, not cool.\n\nThe ramen had no taste - literally.  No wonder my toddler didn't like it and she LOVES noodles.\n\nThe sushi was ok.  We had the Philadelphia, Rainbow, and Tempura shrimp.  Nothing great but better than our last experience at A Hai.\n\nOur friends got the egg roll and it looked like 1 egg roll cut up into a whole bunch of pieces and cost $4.  Maybe it was 2 egg rolls but it sure didn't look it.  I guess it's not totally unheard of to charge $4 for 2 egg rolls but I was not impressed.

When this place first opened we were so excited because it was much closer to home, at the time the service was excellent and fast, and the quality and quantity was worth the price. Forget that! You'd be better off going to the grocery store and buying their sushi. \n\nWe ordered a total of 4, count them, 4 rolls tonight. The first roll was delivered rather quickly. Nice surprise, however it wasn't one of the ones I had ordered so I waited patiently. The second roll, again, not one that I had ordered was delivered probably within the next 5-10 minutes later. Wow, we thought. Service seems a little better than last time. BIG MISTAKE FOR THINKING THAT!!!!!!!! Holy crap, sat waiting for almost another 30-35 minutes watching all these other orders going out for people who came in some time AFTER, yes I said AFTER, we did but not our 2 measly rolls. \n\nWe also had to be our own server when it came to refilling our drink. Server never came back to refill so I got up and refilled our drinks myself. Too bad we didn't order alcohol because i would have gone back to get that as well. \n\nI finally decided I had had enough and we got up to leave. When I was approaching the female server to ask for a bill for the sushi we did get and explain the situation she walked right by me like I was invisible or something. She came past me a second time and when I started to speak to her, she ignored me and walked over to a table that was cancelling an order because it was taking too long for them as well. When she walked past me the 3rd time and ignored me I happened to mention in a loud voice that I must be standing there for my health or something. Finally I walked over to the curtain that they have to divide the register, kitchen and hall to bathrooms from the dining area and told the lady we wanted to cancel our order, wanted the bill for what we got and that we would never come back again because service was so horrible. She said OK thank you, so we walked out. \n\nHey, wait a minute, I think they owe me money since I had to play waitress. \n\nYou know, we love, and I mean love sushi but I'd rather have to drive out of the way to a place where I know we will get service promptly and with a smile even if the place is packed to the gills, no pun intended"

The only complaint is that sometimes the servers are overwhelmed on the weekends and I don't get refills on my drinks on those days. They need to hire more staff for the busy weekends...this place is always packed with customers. I will eat here everytime I come back to town even without the refills on drinks the Las Vegas roll is awesome !"

This place does not get crowded, but plenty of people do come here.(based on Fri or Sat night) Last time I was here I had their Rainbow roll, Spicy tuna roll, and Las Vegas roll.  The  Rainbow and Spicy tuna rolls where really good, but the one that suprised me was the Las Vegas roll(had me bobbing my head) ofcourse a sign that it was enjoyable and delicious!

Each visit, we order something new (and we've been coming here once a week for several months now).  The cut and quality of the sashimi is consistent, the rolls are always prepared immaculately.  The miso soup is perfect.  Do not believe the negative reviews.  Believe the reviews of those of us who come here on a regular basis to enjoy fine quality sushi.  I have never seen this place short staffed, nor have I had a roll that fell apart because it wasn't prepared properly.  We have never waited long for our food, ever."

The rolls and sushi are abundant and fresh.  I suggest the Las Vegas roll: it's spicy and cream-cheesy.  \n\nThe staff is friendly and efficient.  A definite bonus."

Their happy hour menu is pretty huge and can satisfy your, fresh/raw or savory/cooked cravings. Not only is their sushi great, but their entrees as well. Happy Hour here isn't the standard Mon-Thurs.

We felt the food, service, and price just didn't add up. We then started to visit the Ah-So place right up the street because of their happy hour specials. We decided to give the Akai-Hana grill another chance after a terrible dining experience one night at Ah-So.\n\nIt's the only place we've been to lately. We've discovered their happy hour and reverse happy hour menus and they are great. The service has greatly improved and they have 2 sushi chef's behind the bar finally. \n\nIf you haven't been there in a year because of a bad experience, give it a try again.

I mentioned a sushi roll to my friend since it looked interesting (neither of us wanted to try it and told the server this) but he brought it out anyway. He did not charge us for it though so that was alright.\n\nThe main reasons for the low stars is that although the variety of sushi is great, they don't make it that well. Also the use of sesame seeds on top of every roll is unneeded. The soy sauce was bland and not the brand it said it was. Also when one of my friends was eating their sushi roll they found a bone in their yellow tail.\n\nNot an experience I wish to repeat. The only reason they get 2 stars is because the server was quite nice about everything."

Let me first point out that I love the reverse happy hour that they do between 8pm-10pm. Prices on meals are incredibly cheap. My wife and I usually end up getting out the door with a few plates and drinks for 25 bucks. The pricing I think is wonderful.\n\nThe service is also excellent. It's usually not long even with a packed restaurant to get your food. Service seems to be very attentive my drink gets near 1/4 and the server is around to check if I want a refill and need anything. They take plates as you finish them and im not left piling them up at the side of the table hoping someone will pick them up like at other restaurants.\n\nOverall i've been happy with just about every dish from this place. I don't claim to be a Sushi expert, but no dish thus far has been distasteful or of poor quality. I really like the crab rangoons for an appetizer, and the blue flame and golden Buddha are great. \n\nOverall i'm very happy with this restaurant and I enjoy my experiences here each time that I go."

The Phoenix took a little longer, but I thought it was really tasty.\n\nThe staff was very nice and helpful with any questions I had. The water I had tasted... like water and was refreshing enough for me. \n\nThe place seems to have a lot of traditional Japanese dishes I don't always find at every Japanese restaurant I go to. Also, the majority of the staff were speaking... Japanese, which strangely seems rare from the places I have been to in the Valley.\n\nI will definitely be back to check some of the other stuff on their menu (like their sukiyaki that is for a minimum of 2 people, that sounds like fun)."

You can't go wrong with Akai Hana, the sushi is the best in town and the prices are zoo cheep.

Another great roll is the Golden Buddah. My kids don't like sushi but they love getting the chicken Tatsuta.
