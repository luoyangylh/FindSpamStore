****Find Spam Store****

**INTRODUCTION**

Do you believe the official scores in Yelp’s system? Do you ever consider the situation that some stores may hire workers to increase their scores?
In this case, customers cannot get founded evaluations of each stores. We question the score system which only uses customers’ rating. Reviews’ text contains lots of useful info related to the features that determine whether the store is good or not.

Thus, we want to use the review content and customers’ relationship between each other to build a new score system to re-score each store in different categories. After each store has their new scores, we will compare them to the official scores and find those stores which have huge difference between its new score and its official score, i.e. those stores are more likely have spam reviews.

Last but not least, we want to change the review showing timeline. Now the Yelp system show the reviews according to their posting time. But the most helpful review may be buried by other latest reviews. We will combine the qualities of customers’ reviews and customers’ relationship to give them “review authority”, i.e. foodies’ reviews are more influential, and help the useful reviews rank up.
